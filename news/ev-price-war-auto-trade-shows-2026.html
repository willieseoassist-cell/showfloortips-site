            <p>At Auto Shanghai 2025, BYD's exhibit occupied 54,000 square feet of prime floor space -- larger than the booths of Volkswagen, Toyota, and General Motors combined. The Chinese automaker, which surpassed Tesla in global EV sales in 2024 and didn't look back, had transformed its booth into a miniature city: a two-story structure with a rooftop viewing deck, six interactive driving simulators, a live orchestra, and 23 vehicles on display, including three global debuts. Across the aisle, a legacy European automaker that had once commanded an equally massive presence was squeezed into a space roughly one-third the size, with five cars and a coffee bar. Welcome to the new geography of the automotive trade show floor.</p>

            <p>The electric vehicle price war that has consumed the global auto industry since 2023 is not just reshaping which cars people buy. It's fundamentally transforming who exhibits at automotive trade shows, how much they spend, how their booths look, and what the competitive dynamics feel like when you're standing on the floor watching your rival's exhibit draw four times the crowd yours does. For exhibitors across the automotive supply chain -- and increasingly, exhibitors in adjacent industries like energy, technology, and materials -- the EV disruption has redrawn the rules of trade show engagement.</p>

            <div class="stat-callout">
                <div class="stat-number">62%</div>

            </div>

            <h2>The New Power Players</h2>

            <p>The shift in trade show floor dominance mirrors the shift in the market itself, but it's happening even faster. Market share changes gradually. Booth size can change show to show.</p>

            <h3>BYD: The Biggest Booth in Every Room</h3>
            <p>BYD sold over 4.2 million vehicles in 2025, making it the fourth-largest automaker in the world by volume and the largest EV manufacturer by a wide margin. Its trade show strategy reflects both its scale and its ambitions. At every major auto show -- Shanghai, Beijing, Bangkok, Geneva, and increasingly Detroit -- BYD takes the largest or second-largest booth on the floor. The company's exhibit budgets are estimated at $8-12 million per show for its flagship appearances, dwarfing what most legacy OEMs spend. BYD uses these shows not just to launch vehicles but to recruit dealers, attract supply chain partners, and project dominance in markets it's entering for the first time.</p>

            <h3>The Chinese Cohort</h3>
            <p>BYD is the most visible, but it's far from alone. NIO, XPeng, Li Auto, Geely (including its Zeekr brand), Chery, Great Wall Motor's ORA and Tank brands, and a dozen smaller Chinese EV makers have collectively transformed the exhibitor landscape at automotive trade shows worldwide. At Auto Guangzhou 2025, Chinese brands occupied 70% of the exhibit floor. At the Bangkok International Motor Expo, Chinese EV brands went from zero presence in 2020 to commanding 35% of exhibit space in 2025. Even at European shows, the Chinese contingent has expanded rapidly: the Munich IAA (Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung) saw its Chinese exhibitor count triple between 2021 and 2025.</p>

            <h3>Tesla's Anti-Booth Strategy</h3>
            <p>Tesla remains the notable outlier. The company has largely avoided traditional auto shows, preferring its own launch events and retail showrooms. When Tesla does appear, it's often with a small, minimalist exhibit -- a single vehicle on a white platform, no sales staff, no brochures. This anti-booth philosophy has actually worked in Tesla's favor at times, creating exclusivity and buzz. But it has also ceded enormous floor space to competitors who are happy to fill the void. At shows where Tesla is absent, BYD and other Chinese brands explicitly market into the gap, positioning their vehicles as alternatives in the space Tesla chose to vacate.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "I've been attending the Detroit Auto Show for 22 years. The transformation is staggering. In 2018, the Big Three dominated the floor. GM, Ford, and Stellantis had the biggest booths, the best locations, the splashiest reveals. In 2025, GM downsized by 40%. Ford split its exhibit between ICE and EV brands in a way that felt disjointed. And there was BYD, in the main hall, with an exhibit that looked like it belonged at CES. The power dynamics have completely inverted."
                <cite>-- Automotive Journalist, 22-Year Detroit Auto Show Veteran</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>What Happens When Your Competitor Outspends You 3-to-1</h2>

            <p>The practical challenge facing legacy automakers and their supply chains at trade shows is acute and largely unprecedented. For decades, the trade show floor reflected an established hierarchy. The largest OEMs got the largest booths, the prime locations, the opening-night reveals. Smaller players worked around the edges. The hierarchy was stable because the market was stable.</p>

            <p>The EV price war has destabilized that hierarchy. Chinese EV makers, many of which benefit from government subsidies, favorable lending from state-owned banks, and lower domestic manufacturing costs, can outspend Western and Japanese competitors on trade show exhibits while simultaneously undercutting them on vehicle pricing. BYD's Seagull, an electric hatchback priced under $10,000 in China, is the embodiment of this dynamic. How do you justify a $5 million booth budget to your CFO when your competitor is selling a functional EV for less than the cost of your exhibit?</p>

            <p>The answer, increasingly, is that legacy OEMs are not justifying those budgets. They're cutting them. Several major automakers have reduced their auto show calendars from six or seven global shows to three or four. Some have pulled out of specific shows entirely: Stellantis skipped the 2025 Paris Motor Show. BMW scaled back at Shanghai. Toyota reduced its footprint in Bangkok. The trade show floor, like the market, is being ceded to the companies with the most aggressive growth strategies and the deepest willingness to spend.</p>

            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <strong>Key Takeaway</strong>
                If you're a supplier, component maker, or service provider in the automotive trade show ecosystem, the shift in OEM exhibitor dynamics directly affects you. Follow the money. If Chinese OEMs are becoming the anchor exhibitors at the shows you attend, start building relationships with their procurement teams now. These companies are actively building supply chains outside China, and trade shows are where they're meeting potential partners. Being visible at the shows where they're investing is the first step.
            </div>

            <h2>The Booth Arms Race: How EV Exhibits Have Changed the Game</h2>

            <p>The EV disruption hasn't just changed who's on the floor. It's changed what the floor looks like. Chinese EV companies have introduced an exhibiting style that blends automotive tradition with consumer electronics showmanship and experiential marketing in ways that the legacy automakers are struggling to match.</p>

            <h3>The Tech-Forward Booth</h3>
            <p>Traditional auto show booths were built around turntables, spotlights, and attractive models standing next to cars. The new EV booth looks more like an Apple Store crossed with a theme park. BYD's exhibits feature massive LED walls showing cinematic content, interactive touchscreens explaining battery technology, VR test-drive experiences, and live teardown displays where attendees can see the vehicle's electric drivetrain disassembled. NIO builds "NIO House" replicas on the show floor, complete with lounges, coffee bars, and childcare areas, reflecting its brand identity as a lifestyle company rather than just an automaker.</p>

            <h3>The Software Demo</h3>
            <p>EVs are software-defined vehicles, and the exhibits reflect it. Where legacy automakers focus on horsepower, towing capacity, and interior materials, EV makers lead with their infotainment systems, autonomous driving capabilities, and over-the-air update roadmaps. XPeng's booth at CES 2026 was essentially a technology demo, with attendees spending more time interacting with the vehicle's AI assistant and autonomous parking system than looking at the exterior design. This blurs the line between auto show and tech show, and it's drawing a different type of attendee -- one more interested in innovation than in chrome trim packages.</p>

            <h3>The Charging Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>A growing segment of auto show floor space is now dedicated not to vehicles but to charging infrastructure. ChargePoint, EVgo, Electrify America, Tesla's Supercharger network (now open to other brands), and Chinese charging companies like Star Charge and TELD are all expanding their trade show presence. At the Detroit Auto Show 2025, the charging pavilion occupied more floor space than several major vehicle brands. This reflects the market reality: the EV transition is not just about cars but about the entire ecosystem of energy delivery, and trade shows are where that ecosystem comes together.</p>

            <h2>The Supply Chain Exhibitor Dilemma</h2>

            <p>For the thousands of companies that supply the automotive industry -- from tier-one component manufacturers to specialty chemical producers to tooling companies -- the EV trade show transformation creates a strategic dilemma. The customer base is shifting. Chinese OEMs, which historically sourced almost entirely domestically, are now actively seeking international supply chain partners as they expand into Europe, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and eventually North America. But building relationships with these new customers requires showing up at the shows they attend, which may be different from the shows you've always attended.</p>

            <p>Auto Shanghai, Auto Guangzhou, and the Beijing Motor Show are now essential for supply chain exhibitors who want to do business with Chinese OEMs. The Bangkok International Motor Expo has become critical for the Southeast Asian market, where Chinese EVs are outselling Japanese vehicles for the first time. Even at Western shows, supply chain exhibitors need to position themselves near the Chinese OEM exhibits to catch the attention of procurement teams who are walking the floor with specific sourcing mandates.</p>

            <p>Conversely, some shows are losing relevance for suppliers. The Paris Motor Show, once a crown jewel of the European auto show circuit, has seen declining OEM participation and is struggling to justify the cost for suppliers. The Tokyo Motor Show (now Japan Mobility Show) remains strong domestically but has become less internationally diverse. Supply chain exhibitors need to continuously re-evaluate their show calendar based on where the OEMs they want to reach are actually exhibiting, not where they exhibited five years ago.</p>

            <h2>The Geopolitical Layer</h2>

            <p>The EV trade show transformation has an unavoidable geopolitical dimension. The European Union imposed tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese EVs in 2024. The United States maintained a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs. Canada followed with its own tariffs. These trade barriers are reshaping which shows matter and how companies use them.</p>

            <p>Chinese OEMs are using trade shows in tariff-free or low-tariff markets -- Thailand, Brazil, the UAE, Indonesia -- as beachheads for global expansion. The exhibits at these shows are not just product launches; they're geopolitical statements, signals to local governments that Chinese automakers are committed to investing in the region. For Western exhibitors, the tariff landscape adds another layer of complexity to show selection: a show in a market where Chinese competitors face high barriers is a safer competitive environment, while a show in an open market may feature much more aggressive Chinese competition.</p>

            <h2>What Exhibitors Should Do Now</h2>

            <p>The EV transformation of automotive trade shows is accelerating, not plateauing. Here's how exhibitors across the automotive ecosystem should respond.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Remap your show calendar to follow the money.</strong> If Chinese OEMs are your target customers or your most dangerous competitors, you need to be at the shows where they're making their biggest investments. That means prioritizing Shanghai, Bangkok, and Munich over some traditional Western shows.</li>
                <li><strong>Upgrade your booth technology.</strong> The EV exhibitors have raised the bar for booth production values. Interactive screens, immersive demos, and live technology showcases are no longer optional for automotive exhibitors. A static display with printed banners looks outdated next to an EV brand's experiential booth.</li>
                <li><strong>Tell an electrification story.</strong> Whether you make brake pads, seat fabrics, or factory automation equipment, find and articulate your connection to the EV transition. Buyers at automotive trade shows are increasingly focused on electrification, and suppliers who can demonstrate EV-specific value will get more meetings.</li>
                <li><strong>Build relationships with Chinese procurement.</strong> Staff your booth with Mandarin speakers at shows with significant Chinese attendance. Prepare materials in simplified Chinese. Understand the procurement processes and timelines of Chinese OEMs, which often move faster than their Western counterparts.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't ignore the charging and energy segment.</strong> The EV ecosystem extends well beyond the vehicle itself. Battery technology, charging infrastructure, energy management, and grid integration are all massive growth categories with their own trade show presence. If your products or services touch any of these areas, explore exhibiting at energy and utility trade shows in addition to traditional auto shows.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Floor Tells the Truth</h2>

            <p>Trade show floors have always been an honest reflection of industry power dynamics. When an industry shifts, the floor shifts with it -- sometimes before the market data catches up. The EV price war, led by BYD and the broader Chinese EV industry, has produced the most dramatic rearrangement of automotive trade show real estate in modern history. Legacy brands are shrinking. New entrants are expanding. The exhibitor hierarchy that held for decades has been overturned in less than five years.</p>

            <p>For every company in the automotive ecosystem, the message is clear: the show floor is not going back to the way it was. The new exhibitors are not going away. The booth budgets are not getting smaller. The question is not whether the trade show landscape has changed -- it has, irrevocably. The question is whether you'll adapt your strategy to match the new reality or keep exhibiting as if it's still 2019.</p>

            <p>On the trade show floor, denial is the most expensive strategy of all.</p>
