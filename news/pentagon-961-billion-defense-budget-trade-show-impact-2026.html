    <p>With the FY2026 defense appropriations now signed into law and the Department of Defense operating under a $961.6 billion budget — a 13.4 percent increase over FY2025 — the defense trade show circuit is poised for one of its most consequential years in recent memory. The budget includes a historic first: a dedicated $13.4 billion line item for autonomy and AI systems, signaling that artificial intelligence is no longer a side project in military procurement but a central pillar of national defense strategy. For exhibitors preparing for <a href="https://www.ausa.org/" target="_blank">AUSA</a>, <a href="https://seaairspace.org/" target="_blank">Sea-Air-Space</a>, and other defense exhibitions, the implications are immediate and far-reaching.</p>

    <h2>A Budget That Rewards Innovation</h2>

    <p>The Pentagon's proposed budget allocates $179 billion for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation — a staggering 27 percent year-over-year increase. This is the clearest signal yet that the DoD is prioritizing next-generation capabilities over legacy systems. The $25 billion earmarked for the Golden Dome for America missile defense initiative alone represents a massive opportunity for contractors and technology vendors in the space and missile defense sectors.</p>

    <p>Service-level breakdowns reveal where the money is flowing: $301.1 billion for the U.S. Air Force, $292.2 billion for the U.S. Navy, $197.4 billion for the U.S. Army, and $170.9 billion in defense-wide spending. The final appropriations bill added an additional $8.5 billion to the base defense budget, bringing it to $839.2 billion in discretionary funding — a clear indication that lawmakers are committed to sustained military modernization.</p>

    <h2>Singapore Airshow Sets the Tone</h2>

    <p>The defense trade show season is already underway. At the Singapore Airshow, which concluded its February 2026 run, Saab offered its Gripen E fighter to India, while Belgium took delivery of its second and third MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones. Meanwhile, the partnership between Adani Defence &amp; Aerospace and Leonardo to develop a helicopter ecosystem in India — focusing on the AW169M and AW109 TrekkerM platforms — underscores the growing importance of international defense partnerships.</p>

    <p>These developments are a preview of the conversations that will dominate the show floor at AUSA Annual Meeting in October and Sea-Air-Space in April. Exhibitors who can demonstrate solutions aligned with the DoD's budget priorities — particularly in AI, autonomous systems, and advanced missile defense — will have a built-in audience of decision-makers with money to spend.</p>

    <h2>AI and Autonomy Take Center Stage</h2>

    <p>The $13.4 billion dedicated to autonomy and AI marks a watershed moment for defense technology companies. This budget line covers everything from autonomous drones and unmanned surface vessels to AI-driven logistics and predictive maintenance systems. For small and mid-size defense contractors, this represents a golden opportunity to break into programs that were previously dominated by the major primes.</p>

    <p>At AUSA and Sea-Air-Space, expect to see a dramatic increase in exhibitors showcasing AI capabilities. Companies that previously positioned themselves as data analytics or software firms are now rebranding as defense AI companies, and the trade show floor will reflect this shift. Booth demonstrations featuring autonomous navigation, computer vision for threat detection, and AI-powered command-and-control systems will be the star attractions.</p>

    <h2>Weapons Production Ramps Up</h2>

    <p>Beyond AI, the budget signals a significant ramp-up in weapons production. Agreements announced in early February aim to increase production of critical systems including the Tomahawk cruise missile, the AMRAAM air-to-air missile, and the SM-3 and SM-6 interceptors. For exhibitors in the munitions and precision-guided weapons space, this translates to increased demand across the supply chain — from raw materials and components to guidance systems and testing equipment.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.shotshow.org/" target="_blank">SHOT Show</a>, while primarily focused on small arms and sporting goods, has seen a growing contingent of defense technology exhibitors in recent years. The increased weapons production budget will likely accelerate this trend, as component manufacturers and precision engineering firms look for new venues to reach military buyers.</p>

    <h2>Artemis II Delay Opens Aerospace Conversations</h2>

    <p>In a related development, NASA's Artemis II mission has been rescheduled to March 2026 after engineers aborted the countdown on February 3 due to a recurring hydrogen leak at the tail service mast umbilical. While this delay is a setback for the lunar program, it also creates a conversation starter for aerospace exhibitors at upcoming shows. Companies offering solutions for hydrogen management, launch infrastructure, and crew safety systems will find a receptive audience among NASA contractors and subcontractors attending defense and aerospace events.</p>

    <h2>How Exhibitors Should Prepare</h2>

    <p>For defense exhibitors mapping out their 2026 trade show strategy, the budget data provides a clear roadmap. Focus your messaging and demos on the areas where the money is flowing: AI and autonomy, missile defense, advanced weapons production, and space capabilities. Ensure your booth staff can speak fluently about how your solutions align with specific budget line items and program requirements. And do not overlook the power of international partnerships — the Singapore Airshow and similar events demonstrate that defense procurement is increasingly a global conversation.</p>

    <p>Sea-Air-Space takes place April 6-8 at the Gaylord National Resort in National Harbor, Maryland. AUSA Annual Meeting returns to the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. in October. Both events will serve as critical venues for defense companies looking to capitalize on the largest defense budget in American history.</p>
