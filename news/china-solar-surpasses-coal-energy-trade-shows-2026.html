    <p>For the first time in history, China's solar power capacity is on track to <strong>surpass coal capacity</strong> in 2026. According to Bloomberg and confirmed by China Daily, solar capacity stood at approximately 1,200 gigawatts at the end of 2025, growing at an average rate of roughly 270 GW per year over the past three years. Coal capacity, by contrast, is expected to reach about 1,333 GW by end of 2026. With China forecast to commission <strong>235 GW of new solar</strong> and 98 GW of new wind capacity this year alone, the crossover is now a matter of months, not years.</p>

    <p>This is not just an energy story. It is a trade show story. The global energy exhibition calendar — from <a href="https://www.intersolar.de/en/home" target="_blank">Intersolar Europe</a> in Munich to <a href="https://www.snec.org.cn/" target="_blank">SNEC PV Power Expo</a> in Shanghai to <a href="https://www.solarpowerinternational.com/" target="_blank">RE+ (formerly Solar Power International)</a> in Anaheim — is being reshaped by the sheer speed of China's renewable buildout, and every exhibitor in the energy space needs to understand what this inflection point means for their 2026 strategy.</p>

    <h2>The Numbers Behind the Historic Crossover</h2>

    <p>The data from Carbon Brief and Yale E360 paints a picture of acceleration that has outrun even optimistic forecasts. By the end of 2026, non-fossil energy sources — led by solar and wind — are expected to account for <strong>63% of China's total power capacity</strong>, while coal's share falls to 31%. Combined wind and solar capacity will make up approximately half of the nation's total installed generation capacity.</p>

    <p>Perhaps most remarkably, coal power generation fell in both China and India simultaneously in 2025 — the first time that has happened in half a century. Electricity generation from coal dropped by 3.0% in India and 1.6% in China, according to Carbon Brief's analysis. In the United States, solar, wind, and battery storage accounted for 92% of all new power capacity added to the grid.</p>

    <p>Clean-energy industries drove more than 90% of investment growth and more than half of GDP growth in China last year, according to Chinese government data. These are not marginal gains — they represent a fundamental restructuring of the world's second-largest economy around renewable energy production.</p>

    <h2>What This Means for Energy Trade Show Exhibitors</h2>

    <p>The solar-surpasses-coal milestone has immediate implications for how energy companies plan their exhibition calendars and booth strategies.</p>

    <p><strong>SNEC PV Power Expo (Shanghai, June 2026)</strong> is the world's largest solar industry event, and this year it will carry historic significance. With China's solar industry producing more capacity than its entire coal fleet, SNEC exhibitors are no longer showcasing a "growing alternative" — they are showcasing the dominant energy technology. Booth messaging that still frames solar as an "emerging" solution will feel outdated. Companies that lead with grid integration, storage pairing, and utility-scale project management will resonate with the 2026 attendee.</p>

    <p><strong>Intersolar Europe (Munich, June 18-20)</strong> remains the premier European solar event, and this year's conference will be dominated by the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which is moving from reporting to enforcement across industrial sectors. European exhibitors need to prepare for conversations about how China's solar dominance affects European industrial competitiveness and what the CBAM means for cross-border solar supply chains.</p>

    <p><strong>RE+ (Anaheim, September 2026)</strong> is North America's largest clean energy event. With U.S. solar, wind, and storage accounting for 92% of new grid capacity, RE+ exhibitors are operating in a market that mirrors China's trajectory. The key difference is pace: China is adding 235 GW of solar annually, while the U.S. added approximately 40 GW in 2025. That gap is itself a trade show talking point — and an opportunity for exhibitors offering solutions that accelerate U.S. deployment.</p>

    <h2>Battery Storage: The Breakout Category at Every Energy Show</h2>

    <p>The solar milestone cannot be separated from the parallel explosion in battery storage. Global storage installations are expected to exceed <strong>100 GW in 2026</strong> for the first time and rise past 200 GW over the coming decade. This makes battery storage the fastest-growing exhibit category at virtually every energy trade show on the calendar.</p>

    <p>Fervo Energy is set to bring online its Cape Station enhanced geothermal facility in Utah in 2026, with the first 100 MW of an eventual 500 MW slated for October — making it the largest enhanced geothermal project ever connected to a grid worldwide. Geothermal has historically been a niche category at energy trade shows, but projects at this scale are pushing it into mainstream exhibition halls alongside solar and wind.</p>

    <p>For exhibitors evaluating their <a href="/roi-calculator.html">trade show ROI</a>, the storage and geothermal categories offer a strategic advantage: they are growing faster than booth space allocation at most shows, which means early movers can secure prime floor positions that will be heavily contested in 2027 and beyond.</p>

    <h2>The Coal Paradox and What It Means for Show Floor Conversations</h2>

    <p>Despite the solar milestone, China's energy picture includes a striking contradiction. Developers submitted proposals for <strong>161 GW of new coal-fired power plants</strong> in 2025 alone, and 291 GW of coal capacity remains in the pipeline, either permitted or under construction. This paradox — building solar at unprecedented speed while simultaneously planning new coal — will be a central debate at energy conferences throughout 2026.</p>

    <p>For exhibitors at shows like <a href="https://www.adipec.com/" target="_blank">ADIPEC</a> (Abu Dhabi, November), <a href="https://www.ceraweek.com/" target="_blank">CERAWeek</a> (Houston, March), and the <a href="https://www.worldfutureenergysummit.com/" target="_blank">World Future Energy Summit</a> (Abu Dhabi, January), this paradox creates a more nuanced conversation than "renewables versus fossil fuels." The reality is that both are expanding simultaneously in the world's largest energy market, and attendees are looking for exhibitors who understand that complexity rather than offering simplistic narratives.</p>

    <h2>Planning Your Energy Trade Show Strategy for 2026</h2>

    <p>The solar-surpasses-coal milestone is not a future prediction — it is happening now. Asia-Pacific is on track to become the world's largest data center market before 2030, with AI-driven energy demand putting unprecedented pressure on power grids. The EU's methane regulations are adding new compliance requirements. And the U.S. clean energy market continues its own rapid expansion.</p>

    <p>For energy exhibitors building their 2026 <a href="/guide.html">trade show calendar</a>, the strategic priorities are clear: lead with storage and grid integration, prepare for CBAM and regulatory conversations, and recognize that the narrative has shifted from "will renewables scale?" to "how fast can we manage the transition?" The show floor will reward exhibitors who have made that same shift.</p>
