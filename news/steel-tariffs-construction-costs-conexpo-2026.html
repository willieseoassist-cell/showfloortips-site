    <p>The U.S. construction industry is staring down a cost crisis that is reshaping every segment of the market. Steel and aluminum imports now face 50 percent tariffs, with similar duties hitting semi-finished copper and intensive copper derivatives. The results are stark: the producer price index for aluminum mill shapes surged 30.5 percent from December 2024 to December 2025 — the largest year-over-year increase since early 2022 — while steel mill products jumped 17 percent over the same period. Aggregate construction costs are estimated to rise roughly 8 percent under current policy conditions, and that figure is already showing up in bid prices across the country. For exhibitors at <a href="https://www.conexpoconagg.com/" target="_blank">CONEXPO-CON/AGG</a> and <a href="https://www.greenbuildexpo.com/" target="_blank">Greenbuild</a>, this is the defining issue of the year.</p>

    <h2>Builder Confidence Takes a Hit</h2>

    <p>The National Association of Home Builders reported in January that builder sentiment has moved lower as affordability concerns continue to weigh heavily on buyers. This is not an abstract statistic — it translates directly into fewer projects breaking ground, longer bid cycles, and more cautious capital expenditure decisions. Forecasters are predicting only about a 1 percent increase in single-family home building in 2026 and a similar 1 percent gain in new home sales, painting a picture of a market that is growing in name only.</p>

    <p>For construction technology exhibitors, this environment creates a paradox. Builders need efficiency-boosting tools more than ever to protect margins, but they are also more cautious about spending on new technology. The winning pitch at CONEXPO will be one that demonstrates rapid payback — ideally within a single project cycle. Solutions that can quantify material savings, reduce rework, or compress schedules by measurable percentages will outperform those selling future-state visions.</p>

    <h2>Data Centers Buck the Trend</h2>

    <p>Despite overall construction spending declining 4.7 percent in real value in 2025, one sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience: data centers. Along with utilities and infrastructure, data center construction has grown steadily, driven by insatiable demand for AI computing capacity and cloud services. This is a critical insight for exhibitors at both CONEXPO and Greenbuild, because the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) requirements for data centers are fundamentally different from traditional commercial construction.</p>

    <p>Companies manufacturing high-capacity cooling systems, advanced electrical distribution equipment, and sustainable energy solutions should position themselves specifically for the data center audience. At Greenbuild, where sustainability is the core theme, the energy efficiency challenge of data centers — which can consume as much electricity as a small city — represents both a problem and a massive market opportunity.</p>

    <h2>The Labor Crisis Deepens</h2>

    <p>As if material cost increases were not enough, the construction industry is simultaneously dealing with workforce disruptions. Aggressive immigration enforcement has created immediate disruptions in major markets, with lasting negative effects on industry capacity. The JLL 2026 U.S. Construction Perspective notes that these labor constraints are compounding the tariff-driven cost increases, creating a double squeeze on contractors.</p>

    <p>For exhibitors in the construction technology and automation space, this labor crisis is actually a tailwind. Robotic systems for bricklaying, concrete finishing, and steel fabrication; drone-based site surveying; and AI-powered project management platforms that maximize the output of smaller crews are all seeing increased demand. At CONEXPO, which is the industry's largest equipment show, the automation pavilion is expected to be one of the most visited areas on the floor.</p>

    <h2>Commercial Real Estate Stress Spreads</h2>

    <p>The tariff and labor pressures are playing out against a backdrop of spreading stress in commercial real estate. According to recent CRE analysis, the challenges have moved beyond the well-documented office sector into industrial and multifamily segments. Industrial real estate is showing early cracks as post-pandemic overbuilding meets weaker logistics demand, while multifamily faces oversupply in parts of the Sun Belt and West.</p>

    <p>However, there are bright spots. Colonnade BridgePort and Fiera Real Estate broke ground on February 11 on Junction Central in Ottawa, a mixed-use residential community where Phase I features two residential towers delivering 498 rental units. This type of urban mixed-use development continues to attract capital, and it represents a sweet spot for construction exhibitors who specialize in modular building systems, sustainable materials, and urban infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>What Exhibitors Should Do Now</h2>

    <p>For companies exhibiting at CONEXPO-CON/AGG or Greenbuild in 2026, the market data demands a specific response. First, lead with cost savings. Every product demo, every brochure, every slide deck should open with how your solution reduces the impact of 50 percent steel tariffs and 30.5 percent aluminum price increases. Second, prepare detailed case studies from the data center and infrastructure sectors — these are the growth markets where budget is flowing. Third, address the labor shortage head-on with automation demonstrations that show measurable productivity gains with smaller crews.</p>

    <p>The construction industry is navigating one of its most challenging cost environments in decades. The exhibitors who acknowledge this reality and offer concrete solutions will earn the trust — and the purchase orders — of contractors and builders who are desperate for an edge.</p>
