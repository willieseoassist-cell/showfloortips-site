<h1>MODEX 2026 vs. Automate 2026: Which Manufacturing Show Deserves Your Time?</h1>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565043666747-69f6646db940?w=1920&q=80" alt="Modern manufacturing and warehouse automation equipment on a trade show floor" loading="lazy">

<p>Two of the biggest industrial trade shows in North America are happening within weeks of each other in 2026, and they share enough overlap in exhibitors and attendees to make budget-conscious teams wonder: do we need to go to both? MODEX 2026 in Atlanta and Automate 2026 in Chicago serve related but distinct segments of the manufacturing and supply chain world. Here is how they compare.</p>

<h2>Show Profiles</h2>
<h3>MODEX 2026</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dates:</strong> April 13-16, 2026</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Georgia World Congress Center, Atlanta, GA</li>
<li><strong>Expected attendance:</strong> 50,000+</li>
<li><strong>Exhibitors:</strong> 1,000+</li>
<li><strong>Floor space:</strong> 630,000+ sq. ft. across three show floors</li>
<li><strong>Registration cost:</strong> Free (exhibits and 200+ education seminars)</li>
<li><strong>Organizer:</strong> MHI (Material Handling Industry)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Automate 2026</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dates:</strong> June 22-25, 2026</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> McCormick Place, Chicago, IL</li>
<li><strong>Expected attendance:</strong> 45,000+</li>
<li><strong>Exhibitors:</strong> 1,000+</li>
<li><strong>Floor space:</strong> 450,000+ sq. ft. across North and South Halls</li>
<li><strong>Registration cost:</strong> Free (show floor and conference sessions)</li>
<li><strong>Organizer:</strong> Association for Advancing Automation (A3)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Head-to-Head Comparison</h2>

<h3>Industry Focus</h3>
<p>This is the most important distinction between the two shows. MODEX covers the entire supply chain ecosystem -- material handling, warehousing, logistics, transportation, packaging, and distribution. You will find conveyor systems next to warehouse management software next to forklift manufacturers. The perspective is broad and operations-centric.</p>
<p>Automate is narrower and deeper. It focuses specifically on automation technologies: robotics, AI, machine vision, motion control, and sensors. If MODEX asks "How do we move goods more efficiently?" then Automate asks "How do we automate the processes that move, assemble, and inspect goods?"</p>

<h3>Attendance and Audience</h3>
<p>MODEX edges out Automate on raw attendance numbers, with 50,000-plus expected compared to Automate's 45,000-plus. More importantly, the audience composition differs. MODEX draws warehouse managers, logistics directors, supply chain VPs, and distribution center operators. Automate attracts automation engineers, plant managers, robotics integrators, and manufacturing executives.</p>
<p>There is meaningful overlap -- companies automating their warehouses will attend both -- but the center of gravity at each show reflects its organizer's focus.</p>

<h3>Exhibitor Overlap</h3>
<p>Roughly 15 to 20 percent of exhibitors appear at both shows. Major robotics companies like FANUC, ABB, and Yaskawa exhibit at both, as do warehouse automation leaders like Dematic, KION Group, and Honeywell Intelligrated. However, MODEX features many exhibitors you will not find at Automate -- forklift manufacturers, racking and shelving companies, packaging equipment suppliers, and third-party logistics providers. Conversely, Automate hosts machine vision specialists, motion control manufacturers, and AI software companies that do not exhibit at MODEX.</p>

<h3>Education and Content</h3>
<p>MODEX offers more than 200 free education seminars covering supply chain strategy, warehouse design, sustainability, and emerging technologies. Keynote speakers in 2026 include Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail and exponential strategist Salim Ismail. The programming is practical and business-oriented.</p>
<p>Automate's conference program is more technically specialized, with deep-dive sessions on robot programming, vision system calibration, AI integration, and safety standards. The Humanoid Robot Forum and NVIDIA-sponsored Humanoid Robot Pavilion are unique draws that reflect Automate's position at the cutting edge of automation technology.</p>

<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>Both shows offer free registration for the exhibit hall and conference sessions, which is rare for events of this scale. Your primary expenses will be travel and lodging. Atlanta hotels near the Georgia World Congress Center typically run $180 to $280 per night during MODEX, while Chicago hotels near McCormick Place range from $200 to $350 per night in late June. Factor in flights and meals, and you are looking at $1,500 to $2,500 per person per show for a three-night trip.</p>

<h3>Networking Quality</h3>
<p>MODEX's networking skews toward supply chain decision-makers with purchasing authority for warehouse infrastructure and logistics solutions. The show's co-location with related events broadens the networking pool. Automate's networking is more concentrated among technical professionals who specify, design, and implement automation systems. If your product requires engineering buy-in before a purchase decision, Automate is the stronger networking environment.</p>

<h2>Who Should Attend Which Show</h2>
<p><strong>Attend MODEX if:</strong> You sell material handling equipment, warehouse management systems, logistics solutions, packaging machinery, or distribution technology. Your buyers are supply chain directors and warehouse operations managers. You want the broadest possible exposure to the movement-of-goods ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Attend Automate if:</strong> You sell or buy robotics, machine vision, motion control, AI software, or manufacturing automation systems. Your buyers are automation engineers and plant managers. You want to see the most advanced automation technology available and connect with the integration community.</p>
<p><strong>Attend both if:</strong> You operate in warehouse automation, autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), or automated guided vehicles (AGVs). These categories sit squarely at the intersection of both shows, and attending both gives you access to the full range of buyers, from the supply chain executive approving the budget to the engineer specifying the system.</p>

<h2>Can You Do Both?</h2>
<p>Yes, and the timing works in your favor. MODEX runs in mid-April and Automate is in late June, giving you more than two months between shows to process leads, refine your pitch, and adjust your booth setup if you are exhibiting. The free registration for both shows also keeps the financial barrier low. The main challenge is team bandwidth -- pulling your best people off the road for two multi-day events within a quarter requires careful planning.</p>

<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p>If you have to pick one, your choice should be driven by where your buyers live in the value chain. MODEX is the better show for companies whose solutions move, store, and ship goods. Automate is the better show for companies whose solutions build, assemble, and inspect goods. For the growing number of companies at the intersection -- particularly those in warehouse robotics and AI-driven logistics -- attending both is not just justifiable, it is a competitive advantage. With free registration and a two-month gap between events, doing both in 2026 is more practical than it has ever been.</p>
