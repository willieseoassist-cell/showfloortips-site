<p>Natural Products Expo West returns to the Anaheim Convention Center from March 3 to 6, 2026, marking its 45th year as the largest natural and organic products trade show in the United States. With more than 70,000 industry professionals and over 3,200 exhibitors expected, Expo West is a powerhouse for building relationships across the natural products value chain.</p>

<p>The sheer scale of the event can be overwhelming for first-timers and veterans alike. This networking guide will help you identify the right people, events, and strategies to turn four days in Anaheim into lasting business relationships.</p>

<h2>Who Attends Expo West?</h2>

<p>Expo West draws a concentrated audience from every segment of the natural, organic, and healthy products industries. Here is who you will find on the show floor and beyond.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Retail Buyers:</strong> Category managers and purchasing teams from Whole Foods Market, Sprouts, Natural Grocers, Kroger's natural division, and thousands of independent natural food stores. These are the decision-makers who can get your product onto shelves.</li>
<li><strong>CPG Brand Founders and Teams:</strong> From bootstrapped startups with a single SKU to established brands with national distribution. Marketing directors, sales teams, and founders attend in force.</li>
<li><strong>Distributors:</strong> Representatives from UNFI, KeHE, and regional distributors walk the floor scouting new products and checking in with current partners.</li>
<li><strong>Investors and Financial Partners:</strong> Venture capital firms, private equity groups, and investment banks with natural products focus attend to evaluate emerging brands and market trends.</li>
<li><strong>Ingredient Suppliers:</strong> Companies providing raw materials, flavoring systems, packaging solutions, and manufacturing services exhibit in dedicated halls.</li>
<li><strong>Media and Influencers:</strong> Food journalists, wellness bloggers, podcast hosts, and social media influencers cover the show extensively, looking for trending products and stories.</li>
<li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Brokers, marketing agencies, contract manufacturers, and certification bodies attend to connect with brands in need of support.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Must-Attend Networking Events</h2>

<h3>CPG Innovation Summit (March 3)</h3>
<p>This pre-show event at the Anaheim Marriott gathers 750 or more attendees, including brands, investors, service providers, and innovators, for a full day focused on growth and opportunity in the CPG space. The summit format encourages conversation and collaboration, making it one of the best networking environments of the entire week. If you are a brand founder or investor, this is worth arriving a day early to attend.</p>

<h3>45th Anniversary Celebration (March 3, 3:00-6:00 PM)</h3>
<p>Taking place at Grand and Arena Plaza, this milestone celebration features a "Through the Decades" theme with nostalgia, networking, and entertainment. The relaxed atmosphere makes it easy to start conversations, and the mix of industry veterans and newcomers creates opportunities for introductions that would be difficult to engineer on the show floor.</p>

<h3>Organic Farmers Market (March 3, 12:00-5:00 PM)</h3>
<p>Held at the Marriott East Lot Tent, this outdoor event combines the appeal of a traditional farmers market with trade show energy. Certified organic products are showcased in an open, walkable format. The casual setting is ideal for striking up conversations with producers, buyers, and fellow attendees without the booth-to-booth formality of the main halls.</p>

<h3>Block Party</h3>
<p>The Expo West Block Party kicks off at 3:00 PM, offering an outdoor setting where attendees can relax, dance, and network under the Anaheim sun. The informal energy breaks down barriers, and it is common to see brand founders and retail buyers sharing a conversation that would never happen in a scheduled meeting.</p>

<h3>Morning Yoga and Wellness Activities</h3>
<p>Expo West offers morning yoga sessions and other wellness activities that attract a smaller, more engaged crowd. These are excellent settings for building connections in a low-pressure environment before the show floor opens.</p>

<h2>Smart Networking Strategies for Expo West</h2>

<h3>1. Map Your Target Exhibitors in Advance</h3>
<p>With 3,200 exhibitors spread across multiple halls, aimless wandering is a waste of your time. Use the Expo West exhibitor directory to build a shortlist of companies and booth numbers organized by priority. Group your visits by hall location to minimize travel time within the massive convention center.</p>

<h3>2. Bring Product Samples If You Are a Brand</h3>
<p>Expo West is a product-driven show. If you are a CPG brand, having samples ready for impromptu tastings during networking events can open doors that a business card alone cannot. Buyers want to taste before they talk distribution.</p>

<h3>3. Work the Hallways and Common Areas</h3>
<p>The spaces between exhibit halls, the outdoor courtyards, and the food service areas are where many deals are seeded. Buyers who are hard to reach in their packed booth schedules are approachable in these neutral zones. Have your 30-second pitch polished and ready.</p>

<h3>4. Leverage the Naturally Network</h3>
<p>The Naturally Network organizes community gatherings and events around Expo West. Their meetups attract a curated group of founders, operators, and investors in the natural products industry. Check their event calendar and RSVP early, as these gatherings tend to fill up quickly.</p>

<h3>5. Schedule Follow-Up Meetings on the Spot</h3>
<p>Do not settle for exchanging cards and promising to "circle back." If a conversation is going well, pull out your phone and schedule a follow-up call or meeting before you part ways. The hit rate on post-show follow-up drops dramatically when you wait more than 48 hours.</p>

<h2>Best Times and Places to Connect</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tuesday, March 3:</strong> Pre-show events are your best networking opportunity. The CPG Innovation Summit, Organic Farmers Market, and 45th Anniversary Celebration all happen before the exhibit halls officially open. Attendees are fresh, excited, and open to conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday-Thursday (9:00-11:00 AM):</strong> The first two hours after the show floor opens are prime time for booth visits. Buyers and exhibitors are energized and have not yet been overwhelmed by the day's meetings.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday-Thursday (3:00-5:00 PM):</strong> Afternoon outdoor events and the Block Party offer natural transitions from business mode to relationship building. The shift in setting encourages more personal conversations.</li>
<li><strong>Evening Hours:</strong> Off-site dinners, brand launch parties, and industry gatherings at Anaheim-area restaurants and hotels are where relationships deepen. Check industry newsletters and LinkedIn for event announcements in the weeks before the show.</li>
<li><strong>Friday, March 6:</strong> The final day is quieter, but that is precisely why it is valuable. Exhibitors have more time for unhurried conversations, and the reduced crowd makes it easier to access the people you may have missed earlier in the week.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical Tips for Anaheim</h2>

<p>The Anaheim Convention Center is walkable from many nearby hotels, but the surrounding area fills up fast during Expo West. Book accommodations early and consider staying within a 10-minute walk of the venue. Parking is limited and expensive, so use the Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle or rideshare services when possible.</p>

<p>Dress comfortably but professionally. Expo West trends more casual than most trade shows, reflecting the culture of the natural products industry. Layers are smart, as Southern California mornings can be cool while afternoon sun heats up the outdoor event areas.</p>

<p>Finally, pace yourself. Four days on your feet sampling products and shaking hands is physically demanding. Stay hydrated, eat well, and protect your voice. The connections you make at Expo West 2026 could define your next product launch, distribution deal, or partnership, so bring your best energy to every interaction.</p>
