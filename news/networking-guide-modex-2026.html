<h1>Networking Guide for MODEX 2026</h1>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1587293852726-70cdb56c2866?w=1200" alt="Large warehouse and logistics facility representing the supply chain industry" loading="lazy">

<p>MODEX 2026 takes over the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta from April 13 to 16, bringing together more than 50,000 supply chain professionals and over 1,000 exhibitors across 630,000 square feet of exhibit space spread across three show floors. As the premier supply chain experience in North America, MODEX offers an unmatched concentration of decision-makers from manufacturing, logistics, warehousing, and transportation.</p>

<p>The best part? Admission is free for supply chain professionals and their teams. But free entry does not mean you should arrive without a plan. Here is how to maximize your networking impact at MODEX 2026.</p>

<h2>Who Attends MODEX?</h2>

<p>MODEX attracts a focused audience of professionals who design, operate, and optimize supply chains. Understanding this audience will help you target the right conversations.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Executives:</strong> Vice presidents and directors of supply chain, logistics, and operations from major manufacturers and retailers. These are the decision-makers with budget authority.</li>
<li><strong>Warehouse and Distribution Managers:</strong> Operations leaders responsible for facility design, workflow optimization, and technology implementation in distribution centers.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing Engineers:</strong> Professionals evaluating automation, robotics, conveyor systems, and material handling equipment for production environments.</li>
<li><strong>IT and Systems Integration Teams:</strong> Professionals focused on warehouse management systems, enterprise resource planning integration, and IoT connectivity.</li>
<li><strong>3PL and Logistics Providers:</strong> Third-party logistics companies scouting technology and solutions to improve service offerings for their clients.</li>
<li><strong>Procurement Specialists:</strong> Buyers evaluating vendors for equipment, software, and services across the material handling spectrum.</li>
<li><strong>Consultants and Integrators:</strong> Supply chain consultants and systems integrators attending to stay current on technology trends and build vendor relationships.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Networking Events at MODEX 2026</h2>

<h3>Keynote Sessions</h3>
<p>The four headline keynotes are not just educational events; they are networking catalysts. The shared experience of watching a major presentation creates natural conversation starters for the hours that follow.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Monday, April 13, 9:00 AM:</strong> Richard McPhail, CFO of The Home Depot, discusses supply chain trends. This opening keynote draws the largest single crowd of the week. Arrive early and use the pre-session seating time to introduce yourself to neighbors.</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday, April 14, 9:00 AM:</strong> Salim Ismail, Founder and Chairman of OpenExO, on AI and transformation. Technology-focused attendees will cluster around this session.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday, April 15, 9:00 AM:</strong> Dale Earnhardt Jr. on perseverance, leadership, and legacy. This cross-industry keynote draws a broad audience and offers a change of pace that loosens up conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday, April 15, 1:00 PM:</strong> MHI Annual Industry Report keynote panel with MHI CEO John Paxton and Deloitte's Wanda Johnson. Data-driven professionals and strategic planners will prioritize this session.</li>
</ul>

<h3>MHI Young Professionals Network Reception (April 13)</h3>
<p>This evening reception on the opening day brings together emerging leaders in material handling and supply chain. If you are early in your career or looking to connect with the next generation of industry decision-makers, this event is a must. The atmosphere is welcoming and the conversations tend to be more open than formal business meetings.</p>

<h3>Women in the Supply Chain Forum (April 14)</h3>
<p>This afternoon forum combines discussion, education, and networking for women in the industry. The structured format encourages meaningful connections, and the community built here often extends well beyond the show itself.</p>

<h3>Industry Night with Jim Gaffigan (Wednesday Evening)</h3>
<p>The ticketed evening entertainment event featuring comedian Jim Gaffigan provides a relaxed atmosphere for relationship building. Shared laughter is a powerful connector, and the post-show mingling period is when business cards fly. Purchase tickets early, as this event typically sells out.</p>

<h2>Networking Strategies for MODEX</h2>

<h3>1. Use the Free Education Seminars as Meeting Points</h3>
<p>MODEX offers over 200 free education seminars covering everything from robotics and automation to sustainability and workforce development. These sessions function as self-selecting networking filters. Attendees in a session on autonomous mobile robots, for example, are precisely the people interested in that technology. Sit near the front, engage during Q&A, and introduce yourself to fellow attendees afterward.</p>

<h3>2. Walk All Three Show Floors Strategically</h3>
<p>The exhibit space spans three show floors, which means you cannot cover everything in a single pass. Dedicate specific time blocks to each floor. The transitions between floors are natural conversation zones where you can meet people heading in the same direction with similar interests.</p>

<h3>3. Attend Live Equipment Demonstrations</h3>
<p>MODEX exhibitors frequently run live demonstrations of robotics, automated storage systems, and conveyor technology. These demonstrations draw crowds and create shared viewing experiences that lead naturally to conversations. Position yourself near other attendees during demos and ask what they thought of the technology on display.</p>

<h3>4. Leverage the MODEX App for Meeting Scheduling</h3>
<p>The official MODEX app allows you to browse exhibitors, view the seminar schedule, and connect with other attendees. Use the app to request meetings with exhibitors before the show and to identify fellow attendees whose profiles align with your networking goals.</p>

<h3>5. Bring Your Operations Challenges</h3>
<p>Unlike shows where networking feels performative, MODEX thrives on problem-solving conversations. Come prepared to describe a specific supply chain challenge you are facing. Exhibitors and fellow attendees alike will engage more deeply when they can offer concrete solutions rather than exchanging generic pleasantries.</p>

<h2>Best Times and Places to Connect</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Monday Morning (8:00-9:00 AM):</strong> The registration and coffee areas are buzzing before the opening keynote. Arrive early and work the crowd during this high-energy window.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Keynote (10:00-11:30 AM):</strong> The show floor opens after the keynote, and attendees fan out with fresh inspiration. This is prime time for booth conversations as energy levels are high.</li>
<li><strong>Midday (12:00-1:30 PM):</strong> Food service areas and nearby restaurants become informal meeting spots. The Georgia World Congress Center's central atrium is a natural gathering point.</li>
<li><strong>Afternoon Seminars (2:00-4:00 PM):</strong> Attend sessions relevant to your business and network with the smaller, more focused groups that form around specific topics.</li>
<li><strong>Evening Events:</strong> The Young Professionals Reception, Women in Supply Chain Forum, and Industry Night are your best opportunities to transition from business connections to genuine relationships.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting the Most Out of Atlanta</h2>

<p>The Georgia World Congress Center is located in downtown Atlanta, within walking distance of hotels, restaurants, and the CNN Center. The surrounding area offers plenty of dinner options for off-site meetings. Centennial Olympic Park, adjacent to the venue, provides an outdoor setting for walking meetings or casual conversations between sessions.</p>

<p>Atlanta's MARTA rail system connects the airport directly to downtown, making the commute straightforward. Book a hotel within the MODEX room block for proximity and the chance to share elevators and lobbies with fellow attendees.</p>

<p>MODEX 2026 is a rare opportunity to see the entire supply chain technology landscape in one place. The professionals you meet here are the same people shaping how goods move around the world. Come with a plan, stay curious, and invest in every conversation. The supply chain community rewards those who show up prepared and engaged.</p>
