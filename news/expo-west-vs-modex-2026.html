<h1>Natural Products Expo West vs MODEX 2026: Which Should You Exhibit At?</h1>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591115765373-5207764f72e7?w=1200" alt="Two trade show floors side by side representing exhibition comparison" loading="lazy">

<p>Spring 2026 presents two of the largest trade shows in the United States within six weeks of each other: Natural Products Expo West in Anaheim (March 3-6) and MODEX in Atlanta (April 13-16). While these shows serve entirely different industries, both attract massive audiences and represent significant investment decisions for exhibitors. If your company operates in food and beverage, wellness, supply chain, logistics, or manufacturing technology, understanding how these two events compare can sharpen your trade show strategy for the year.</p>

<p>This comparison examines the audience, costs, logistics, and ROI profile of each show to help you decide where to allocate your exhibiting budget.</p>

<h2>Audience Comparison</h2>

<h3>Natural Products Expo West</h3>
<p>Expo West draws more than 70,000 industry professionals and over 3,200 exhibitors, making it the largest natural and organic products trade show in the United States. Now in its 45th year, the show is the annual gathering point for the entire natural products value chain.</p>

<p>The audience includes retail buyers from major chains like Whole Foods, Sprouts, Natural Grocers, and Kroger's natural division, as well as thousands of independent natural food store buyers. Brand founders, marketing teams, distributors from UNFI and KeHE, ingredient suppliers, investors, brokers, media, and influencers fill out the attendance. The ratio of buyers to exhibitors is unusually high, which creates a target-rich environment for CPG brands seeking shelf placement.</p>

<h3>MODEX</h3>
<p>MODEX brings together more than 50,000 supply chain professionals and over 1,000 exhibitors across 630,000 square feet at the Georgia World Congress Center. Produced by MHI (the Material Handling Industry association), MODEX is the premier event for manufacturing, logistics, warehousing, and transportation technology.</p>

<p>The audience includes supply chain executives, warehouse operations managers, manufacturing engineers, IT and systems integration teams, 3PL providers, procurement specialists, and consultants. These are the professionals who specify, evaluate, and purchase material handling equipment, automation systems, and supply chain software. Admission is free for qualified professionals, which lowers the barrier to attendance and broadens the visitor pool.</p>

<h2>Show Size and Layout</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Expo West:</strong> 70,000+ attendees, 3,200+ exhibitors. The Anaheim Convention Center hosts the main exhibition halls, with additional programming at the adjacent Anaheim Marriott and outdoor event spaces. The show floor is organized by product category, including natural and organic food, supplements, beauty, pet products, and ingredients. The sheer density of exhibitors means booth sizes tend to be compact, especially for newer brands.</li>
<li><strong>MODEX:</strong> 50,000+ attendees, 1,000+ exhibitors, spread across three show floors totaling 630,000 square feet. Booths at MODEX are generally larger than at Expo West because exhibitors frequently display heavy equipment, robotics, conveyor systems, and automated storage solutions that require significant floor space. The layout is organized by product segment, with dedicated zones for automation, software, packaging, and material handling equipment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Location and Logistics</h2>

<h3>Expo West: Anaheim, California</h3>
<p>The Anaheim Convention Center is located in the heart of the Anaheim Resort district, surrounded by hotels, restaurants, and entertainment options. Many hotels are within walking distance of the venue, which simplifies daily logistics. The closest major airport is John Wayne Airport (SNA), about 20 minutes away, with LAX offering more flight options at roughly 45 minutes. Shipping booth materials to Anaheim is straightforward for domestic exhibitors, and the convention center's receiving operation is well-established given the venue's heavy event calendar.</p>

<p>Southern California weather in early March is mild, with outdoor events and networking functions taking advantage of the pleasant climate. Parking at the convention center is limited and expensive, so plan for shuttle services or rideshare.</p>

<h3>MODEX: Atlanta, Georgia</h3>
<p>The Georgia World Congress Center is located in downtown Atlanta, adjacent to Centennial Olympic Park and the CNN Center. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the busiest airport in the world, provides direct flights from virtually every major city. The MARTA rail system connects the airport to downtown in about 20 minutes. Hotels in the immediate vicinity of the GWCC are plentiful, and the MODEX room block offers competitive rates.</p>

<p>Atlanta in mid-April offers warm weather and the city's extensive restaurant scene provides excellent options for off-site dinners and client meetings. The GWCC is one of the largest convention facilities in the United States, so the logistics infrastructure is well-suited to large-scale events with heavy equipment and oversized freight.</p>

<h2>Exhibitor Costs</h2>

<p>The cost profile of each show reflects its industry and audience structure.</p>

<h3>Expo West Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Booth space:</strong> A standard 10x10 booth at Expo West costs approximately $9,900. Premium locations and larger spaces increase proportionally. First-time exhibitors should budget for the booth package plus sampling supplies, staffing, and marketing materials.</li>
<li><strong>Total exhibitor investment:</strong> Including booth space, build-out, travel, hotel, sampling products, and marketing, a first-time exhibitor with a 10x10 booth should expect to spend $20,000 to $40,000 total. Established brands with larger footprints and hospitality events regularly invest $75,000 to $150,000 or more.</li>
<li><strong>Badge pricing:</strong> Six badges are included with a standard booth. Additional attendee badges are available through the registration process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>MODEX Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Booth space:</strong> MODEX booth pricing varies by size and location, with costs reflecting the larger booth footprints common at industrial trade shows. A standard inline booth starts in the mid-four-figure range, while island booths and premium positions command significantly higher rates.</li>
<li><strong>Total exhibitor investment:</strong> Including booth space, equipment shipping and installation, staffing, travel, and marketing, a mid-sized exhibitor should budget $30,000 to $80,000. Large exhibitors with live demonstrations and custom builds can invest $150,000 or more.</li>
<li><strong>Admission:</strong> Attendee admission is free, which means exhibitors benefit from a lower barrier to foot traffic. Exhibitor badge costs are included in the booth package.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ROI Comparison</h2>

<h3>Expo West ROI Profile</h3>
<p>Expo West delivers ROI through direct buyer connections. The show's greatest value is the concentration of retail buyers under one roof. A single meeting with a Whole Foods category manager or a KeHE distribution representative can lead to retail placement worth hundreds of thousands in annual revenue. For emerging brands, the "discovery" factor is also significant: media coverage, influencer attention, and NEXTY Award nominations can generate brand awareness that translates to consumer demand.</p>

<p>The ROI timeline at Expo West is relatively short. Buyer meetings in March often lead to purchase orders by summer. The show also serves as a product launch platform, with many brands timing new SKU introductions to coincide with Expo West for maximum visibility.</p>

<h3>MODEX ROI Profile</h3>
<p>MODEX delivers ROI through lead generation and relationship building in a longer sales cycle. Supply chain technology purchases, especially automation systems, robotics, and enterprise software, involve capital expenditure decisions with evaluation periods of 6 to 24 months. The ROI from MODEX is measured in the pipeline generated rather than immediate purchase orders. A single qualified lead for an automated storage and retrieval system, for example, can represent a deal worth $500,000 to several million dollars.</p>

<p>The free education seminars at MODEX also provide ROI through thought leadership positioning. Exhibitors who sponsor or speak at sessions gain credibility and visibility that supports the sales cycle long after the show ends.</p>

<h2>Which Show Should You Choose?</h2>

<p>For most exhibitors, the choice is straightforward because the industries do not overlap. If you sell consumer packaged goods, ingredients, supplements, or natural products, Expo West is your show. If you sell material handling equipment, warehouse automation, supply chain software, or logistics technology, MODEX is your show.</p>

<p>The more interesting decision arises for companies that serve both worlds. Packaging companies, cold chain logistics providers, food safety technology firms, and sustainability-focused solution providers may find relevant buyers at both events. In that case, consider these factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sales cycle length:</strong> If you need faster revenue recognition, Expo West's shorter buyer-to-purchase-order timeline is advantageous. If your solution requires a longer evaluation and your pipeline can sustain a 6 to 18 month conversion window, MODEX may deliver higher-value contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Staffing availability:</strong> The six-week gap between the shows (March 3-6 for Expo West, April 13-16 for MODEX) is sufficient to allow the same team to attend both, though booth fatigue is a real consideration.</li>
<li><strong>Budget allocation:</strong> If you can only exhibit at one, choose the show where the highest concentration of your decision-makers will be present. If you can attend one as an exhibitor and the other as a visitor, consider exhibiting at your primary show and walking the floor at the secondary show to scout opportunities for the following year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both Expo West and MODEX are best-in-class events for their respective industries. The exhibitors who succeed at either show are the ones who arrive with clear objectives, a target list of prospects, and a follow-up plan that begins before the show floor opens. Choose the event that puts you in front of your buyer, and execute with discipline.</p>
