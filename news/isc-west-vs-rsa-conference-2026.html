<h1>ISC West vs RSA Conference 2026: Which Should You Exhibit At?</h1>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563986768609-322da13575f2?w=1200" alt="Security professionals reviewing technology displays at a major industry conference" loading="lazy">

<p>Security is no longer one industry. It is two, and they are converging. ISC West (March 31 - April 3 in Las Vegas) is the largest physical security trade show in the Americas, while RSA Conference (April 6-9 in San Francisco) is the world's premier cybersecurity event. They happen just days apart in 2026, forcing exhibitors who operate at the intersection of physical and digital security to make a difficult budget decision, or to mount the logistical challenge of attending both.</p>

<p>This comparison breaks down the key differences to help you decide where your trade show investment will generate the strongest return.</p>

<h2>Audience Comparison</h2>

<h3>ISC West</h3>
<p>ISC West draws over 29,000 attendees and 750 exhibitors focused squarely on physical security: video surveillance, access control, intrusion detection, fire and life safety, drones, and security robotics. The audience is dominated by systems integrators and installers, who represent the channel through which most physical security products reach end users. Corporate security directors, facility managers, loss prevention professionals, and law enforcement officers round out the attendee base. The buying process in physical security is hardware-intensive and project-driven, with integrators specifying, installing, and servicing the equipment.</p>

<p>If you sell cameras, readers, panels, sensors, locks, or the software platforms that manage them, ISC West puts you in front of the people who buy, install, and recommend those products.</p>

<h3>RSA Conference</h3>
<p>RSA Conference attracts more than 45,000 attendees and over 650 exhibitors focused on cybersecurity: network security, endpoint protection, identity and access management, cloud security, threat intelligence, security operations, and governance, risk, and compliance. The audience is heavily weighted toward CISOs, security architects, IT directors, SOC analysts, and compliance officers. Enterprise end users are a much larger proportion of the audience compared to ISC West, and the buying process centers on software subscriptions, managed services, and SaaS platforms.</p>

<p>If you sell firewalls, SIEM platforms, zero-trust architectures, penetration testing tools, or managed detection and response services, RSA is where your buyer community gathers at scale.</p>

<h2>Show Size and Scale</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>ISC West:</strong> 29,000+ attendees, 750+ exhibitors, held at the Venetian Expo in Las Vegas. The show floor is organized by product category, with dedicated areas for access control, video surveillance, fire and life safety, and emerging technology. The co-located ISC East preview events and SIA education sessions add depth beyond the exhibit floor. The show runs four days, including a pre-show education day.</li>
<li><strong>RSA Conference:</strong> 45,000+ attendees, 650+ exhibitors, held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Despite having fewer exhibitors than ISC West, RSA draws a significantly larger audience because of its massive conference program featuring over 400 sessions, keynotes from global security leaders, and specialized tracks for every cybersecurity discipline. The show runs four days with additional pre-conference workshops and training sessions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Location and Logistics</h2>

<h3>ISC West: Las Vegas, Nevada</h3>
<p>The Venetian Expo offers modern, well-organized exhibition space connected to the Venetian and Palazzo hotel complex. Las Vegas provides abundant hotel inventory at varying price points, direct flights from nearly every US city, and a well-established convention infrastructure. Shipping booth materials to Las Vegas is straightforward with multiple drayage and logistics providers. Evening entertainment and client dinner options are virtually unlimited. For US-based exhibitors, the logistics are as easy as trade shows get.</p>

<h3>RSA Conference: San Francisco, California</h3>
<p>The Moscone Center is located in San Francisco's SoMa district, surrounded by hotels, restaurants, and bars. San Francisco hotel rates during RSA week are among the highest of any US trade show, often exceeding $400 per night for standard rooms. The city is accessible via SFO and OAK airports, though ground transportation can be slow during peak hours. The walkable area around Moscone makes it convenient for meetings and dinners, but the higher cost of everything in San Francisco, from meals to rideshares, adds up quickly. Companies coming from outside the Bay Area should budget 20 to 30 percent more for overall expenses compared to a Las Vegas show.</p>

<h2>Exhibitor Costs</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>ISC West:</strong> Booth space at ISC West is competitively priced relative to the audience quality. Standard 10x10 booth packages start in the mid-four-figure range, making it accessible for smaller security manufacturers and startups. A mid-sized exhibitor with a 20x20 booth, including construction, graphics, staffing, travel, and hospitality, can expect a total investment in the $50,000 to $120,000 range. The SIA New Products and Solutions Showcase offers additional visibility at an incremental cost.</li>
<li><strong>RSA Conference:</strong> RSA booth space is priced at a premium reflecting the high-value cybersecurity audience. Standard booth packages start higher than ISC West, and prime floor locations command significant surcharges. A comparable mid-sized presence at RSA, including the booth, San Francisco hotel rates, flights, and client entertainment, typically runs $80,000 to $180,000. RSA also offers sponsored speaking sessions, sponsored content, and innovation sandbox competitions that add cost but provide differentiated visibility.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ROI Potential</h2>

<h3>ISC West ROI Profile</h3>
<p>ISC West delivers its strongest ROI for companies that sell through the integrator channel. A single relationship with a national integrator can generate millions in recurring revenue over multiple years as they specify your products across their project portfolio. The physical security sales cycle is project-based, typically ranging from 30 to 180 days depending on project size. Average deal sizes vary widely, from $5,000 for a small business camera system to millions for an enterprise campus deployment. ISC West is also the industry's primary venue for announcing new products, and a successful launch can generate trade press coverage and integrator interest that pays dividends for months.</p>

<h3>RSA Conference ROI Profile</h3>
<p>RSA delivers its strongest ROI for companies selling enterprise cybersecurity software and services. The audience concentration of CISOs and security directors means that a meaningful percentage of booth visitors have budget authority. Cybersecurity purchasing cycles are driven by annual budget cycles, compliance requirements, and incident response urgency, which means deals can close in 30 to 90 days for urgent needs or stretch to 6 to 12 months for strategic platform purchases. Average contract values are high, particularly for enterprise SaaS platforms and managed security services, where annual contracts commonly exceed six figures. The RSA Innovation Sandbox competition is one of the most watched startup showcases in technology, and being selected as a finalist can accelerate brand awareness dramatically.</p>

<h2>The Convergence Factor</h2>

<p>The most important trend affecting both shows is the convergence of physical and cybersecurity. As cameras connect to IP networks, as access control systems integrate with identity management platforms, and as building management systems become IoT endpoints, the boundary between physical and cyber security is dissolving. Companies that bridge this gap, selling unified security platforms, cyber-physical threat detection, or IT/OT convergence solutions, face a genuine dilemma.</p>

<p>ISC West has responded by expanding its cybersecurity content and exhibitor categories, while RSA has increased coverage of IoT security and physical infrastructure protection. However, neither show has yet become the definitive home for convergence solutions. If your product sits squarely at this intersection, consider the following: ISC West gives you access to the physical security channel that will install and service your hardware components, while RSA gives you access to the IT security leadership that will approve the software and network architecture.</p>

<h2>Which Show Should You Choose?</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Choose ISC West if</strong> your product is primarily hardware-based or channel-sold through security integrators. If your revenue depends on integrator partnerships, dealer networks, or distributor relationships, ISC West is where those partners evaluate and commit to new product lines. The lower cost of exhibiting and the Las Vegas logistics make it the more accessible option for companies with constrained budgets.</li>
<li><strong>Choose RSA Conference if</strong> your product is primarily software or services sold directly to enterprise security teams. If your buyer is a CISO, a security architect, or a compliance officer, RSA concentrates those decision-makers at unmatched density. The higher cost of exhibiting is justified by the enterprise contract values typical in cybersecurity.</li>
<li><strong>Choose both if</strong> your company offers a converged physical-cyber security platform and has the budget and team depth to staff two shows in consecutive weeks. The one-week gap between ISC West closing (April 3) and RSA opening (April 6) is tight but manageable with planning. Use ISC West to build your integrator channel and RSA to close enterprise end-user deals. This dual strategy is expensive but increasingly common among companies positioned at the convergence point.</li>
</ol>

<p>The security industry is consolidating around the idea that a threat is a threat regardless of whether it arrives through a door or a data port. Your trade show strategy should reflect where your specific buyer spends their time today, even as both audiences increasingly overlap. Choose the show where you will have the highest concentration of qualified conversations per hour on the floor, and the answer becomes clear.</p>
