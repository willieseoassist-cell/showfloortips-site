    <h2>Overview: Healthcare IT's Premier Gathering</h2>
    <p>HIMSS 2026 returns to the Las Vegas Convention Center from March 9 through 12, bringing together more than 28,000 health information and technology professionals for four days of education, innovation, and deal-making. Organized by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, this annual conference is the single most important networking event on the healthcare IT calendar. CIOs, CMIOs, clinical informaticists, health system executives, startup founders, and enterprise software sales teams all converge under one roof.</p>
    <p>The healthcare IT market is projected to exceed $970 billion globally by 2027, and HIMSS is where the partnerships that drive that growth are formed. Whether you are selling an EHR integration, pitching a clinical AI platform, seeking a health system pilot, or exploring career opportunities, your success at HIMSS depends on the quality of the conversations you have and the relationships you build. This guide will help you navigate the event strategically so you walk away with connections that matter.</p>

    <h2>Key Networking Events at HIMSS 2026</h2>
    <p><strong>Opening Keynote and General Sessions.</strong> The HIMSS opening keynote on Monday morning draws the largest single audience of the conference, typically filling the main hall with thousands of attendees. Past keynotes have featured leaders from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, major health system CEOs, and prominent technology executives. The 15 minutes immediately following the keynote, as the crowd disperses into the hallways, offer one of the best spontaneous networking windows of the entire event. People are energized and receptive.</p>
    <p><strong>Interoperability Showcase.</strong> The Interoperability Showcase is a multi-day live demonstration where dozens of health IT vendors demonstrate real-time data exchange using standards like FHIR, HL7, and TEFCA frameworks. The audience here is deeply technical and highly engaged, making it an ideal setting for substantive conversations about integration challenges. If your work involves data exchange, APIs, or clinical workflows, plan to spend significant time in this area.</p>
    <p><strong>HIMSS Innovation Live.</strong> This dedicated zone within the exhibit hall features startups and emerging companies presenting their solutions in a pitch-competition format. Venture capitalists, health system innovation officers, and corporate development leads frequent this area looking for the next breakthrough. If you are a startup, apply to present. If you are an investor or buyer, this is your scouting ground.</p>
    <p><strong>Cybersecurity Command Center.</strong> Given the surge in healthcare data breaches and ransomware attacks, the Cybersecurity Command Center has become one of the most heavily attended features at HIMSS. It draws CISOs, compliance officers, and security vendors, creating a concentrated pool of professionals who share urgent, specific challenges. The conversations here tend to be more candid than typical exhibit hall exchanges because the stakes are so tangible.</p>
    <p><strong>Networking Receptions and Special Events.</strong> HIMSS hosts an official networking reception, typically on Monday or Tuesday evening, that is included with full conference registration. Beyond the official events, dozens of vendor-sponsored receptions and dinners take place throughout Las Vegas during the week. Companies like Epic, Oracle Health, Microsoft, Google Health, and Philips host invitation-only events at venues across the Strip. Securing an invitation requires advance outreach. Contact your existing vendor relationships and use LinkedIn to connect with event organizers at companies whose events you want to attend.</p>
    <p><strong>Education Sessions and Workshops.</strong> HIMSS offers more than 300 education sessions across tracks including clinical informatics, cybersecurity, digital health, public health, and health equity. The smaller workshop-format sessions, limited to 50 to 100 participants, create natural networking environments because attendees share a specific interest and often continue conversations in the hallway afterward.</p>

    <h2>Best Networking Spots Inside and Outside the Venue</h2>
    <p><strong>The HIMSS Exhibit Hall Bistro Areas.</strong> The exhibit hall at HIMSS spans hundreds of thousands of square feet, and the bistro and lounge areas scattered throughout provide natural rest stops where attendees gather between booth visits. These seating clusters are among the easiest places to strike up a conversation because everyone there has paused to recharge and is often open to talking.</p>
    <p><strong>The Bookstore and Resource Center.</strong> HIMSS operates a bookstore and resource area where attendees browse the latest health IT publications. The people who stop here tend to be the most intellectually curious attendees at the conference, and a shared interest in a particular book or topic provides an effortless conversation entry point.</p>
    <p><strong>Hotel Lobbies at the Venetian, Wynn, and Encore.</strong> These three properties are among the most popular with HIMSS attendees, and their lobbies and bars become unofficial meeting venues from early morning through late evening. Many executives prefer to schedule meetings in hotel lobbies rather than on the noisy show floor. If you are staying at one of these hotels, use the lobby as your base camp between sessions.</p>
    <p><strong>Restaurant Row on the Strip.</strong> After the exhibit hall closes, healthcare IT professionals migrate to the restaurants and bars along the Las Vegas Strip. Establishments like STK, Carbone at the Aria, and the restaurants inside the Wynn tend to fill with HIMSS attendees during the conference week. A dinner reservation at any popular Strip restaurant virtually guarantees you will be seated near industry peers, and the relaxed setting invites conversation.</p>
    <p><strong>The LVCC West Hall Terrace.</strong> The outdoor terrace area near the West Hall offers fresh air and a quieter atmosphere compared to the packed exhibit halls. Attendees step out here for phone calls and breathers, and the calmer environment makes it easier to have a meaningful one-on-one conversation without shouting over booth demonstrations.</p>

    <h2>Conversation Starters for the Healthcare IT Crowd</h2>
    <p>Healthcare IT professionals are analytical, mission-driven, and often skeptical of vendors who lead with features rather than outcomes. Your conversation approach should reflect that sensibility.</p>
    <p><strong>At a booth:</strong> "What clinical problem does this actually solve, and do you have outcomes data from a live implementation?" Healthcare IT buyers are drowning in vendor pitches. Asking for evidence immediately sets you apart as serious and earns the vendor's respect, often leading to a more candid and productive exchange.</p>
    <p><strong>In an education session:</strong> "Are you dealing with the same interoperability challenges they just described, or is your organization further along? I am trying to benchmark where we stand." This question is specific, humble, and invites the other person to share their experience, which is the fastest way to build rapport in a clinical IT context.</p>
    <p><strong>At the Cybersecurity Command Center:</strong> "What keeps you up at night on the security side? We have been focused on third-party risk management, and I am curious what other organizations are prioritizing." Cybersecurity is a topic where candor is common because everyone faces similar threats, and sharing challenges builds trust quickly.</p>
    <p><strong>At an evening reception:</strong> "How long have you been coming to HIMSS, and how has the conversation changed? I remember when it was all about EHR adoption, and now the topics feel completely different." This invites storytelling and perspective-sharing, which creates a more memorable interaction than a transactional exchange of business cards.</p>
    <p>One critical principle at HIMSS: never lead with a product pitch. The healthcare IT community is tight-knit and reputation-driven. People who are perceived as helpful and knowledgeable earn far more business over time than those who aggressively sell at every interaction.</p>

    <h2>Your Post-HIMSS Follow-Up Strategy</h2>
    <p>HIMSS moves fast. Four days, 28,000 people, hundreds of sessions, and an exhibit hall that takes hours to walk. If you do not have a disciplined follow-up system, the connections you made will evaporate within a week.</p>
    <p><strong>During the show:</strong> After every meaningful conversation, capture the contact and add context immediately. Use a badge scanning tool like Scannly, take a photo of their business card, or add a quick note in your phone. Record what you discussed, what they care about, and any next step you agreed on. By Wednesday afternoon your brain will have blurred dozens of conversations together, and your notes are the only thing that will save you.</p>
    <p><strong>Within 48 hours of the show ending:</strong> Send personalized follow-up messages to your top contacts. Reference something specific from your conversation: the project they mentioned, the challenge they described, the session you both attended. For example: "It was great connecting at the cybersecurity session on Tuesday. The point you made about vendor risk assessments resonated with me, and I would love to share the framework we have been using internally."</p>
    <p><strong>Within two weeks:</strong> For your highest-priority contacts, propose a concrete next step. A 20-minute call, a product demo tailored to their use case, or an introduction to someone in your network who can help with the challenge they described. Specific proposals get responses. Generic "let us stay in touch" messages get archived.</p>
    <p><strong>Ongoing through the year:</strong> Healthcare IT is a relationship business where sales cycles can stretch 12 to 18 months. Add your HIMSS contacts to your CRM, set quarterly check-in reminders, and share relevant content: a new ONC rule, a peer-reviewed study, a HIMSS webinar replay. The goal is to be genuinely useful between conferences so that when budget season arrives or a new initiative launches, you are already a trusted resource rather than a cold email in their inbox.</p>
    <p>HIMSS 2026 is less than a month away. The professionals who get the most value from it are not the ones who attend the most sessions or visit the most booths. They are the ones who have focused, meaningful conversations and follow up with the consistency that the healthcare IT community respects. Plan your targets, prepare your questions, and remember that in this industry, trust is the currency that closes deals.</p>
