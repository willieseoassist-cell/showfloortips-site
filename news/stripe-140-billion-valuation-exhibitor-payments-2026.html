            <p>Stripe is about to become the most valuable private company in the world &mdash; again. According to Bloomberg, the payments giant is arranging a tender offer that would value the company at $140 billion, a 31% premium over its $107 billion valuation from last fall and nearly triple the $50 billion trough it hit during the 2023 tech downturn. For fintech watchers, it is a vindication of Stripe's relentless focus on internet commerce infrastructure. For trade show exhibitors, it is the clearest signal yet that the way money moves on the show floor is about to change fundamentally.</p>

            <p>The trade show industry processes billions of dollars in transactions every year &mdash; exhibitor registrations, booth space purchases, sponsorship fees, on-floor product sales, lead retrieval subscriptions, food and beverage, and the sprawling ecosystem of ancillary services that surrounds every major event. And yet, the payment infrastructure that underpins most of these transactions remains stubbornly outdated. Manual invoicing. Wire transfers with three-day settlement times. Credit card terminals that crash when the convention center Wi-Fi buckles under 40,000 simultaneous connections. Paper receipts.</p>

            <p>Stripe's $140 billion valuation is not just a number. It is a market signal that embedded, seamless, programmable payments are the future &mdash; and the trade show industry is one of the last major sectors to fully embrace them.</p>

            <div class="stat-callout">
                <div class="stat-number">$140B</div>
                <div class="stat-label">Stripe's projected valuation in its upcoming tender offer &mdash; its highest ever, surpassing the 2021 peak of $95 billion</div>
            </div>

            <h2>Why Stripe Matters to Every Exhibitor</h2>

            <p>Stripe is not a consumer-facing brand. Most people have never seen the Stripe logo during a transaction, even though the company processes payments for millions of businesses, from startups to Amazon. Stripe's power lies in its invisible infrastructure: the APIs, payment links, invoicing tools, and financial plumbing that allow any business to accept payments anywhere, in any currency, with minimal friction.</p>

            <p>For trade show exhibitors, this infrastructure solves problems that have plagued the industry for decades.</p>

            <h3>On-Floor Product Sales</h3>
            <p>Exhibitors who sell products directly at trade shows &mdash; a common practice in industries from consumer electronics to specialty food to industrial supplies &mdash; have historically relied on clunky POS terminals, often rented at premium rates from the show's general contractor. Stripe Terminal and similar embedded payment solutions allow exhibitors to process transactions through their own devices, with real-time inventory updates, instant digital receipts, and settlement into their existing bank accounts within 24 hours. The economics are dramatically better: Stripe's standard processing fee of 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction undercuts most trade-show-specific payment providers by 1-3 percentage points.</p>

            <h3>Instant Invoicing for B2B Deals</h3>
            <p>Most trade show transactions are not consumer purchases &mdash; they are B2B commitments. An exhibitor shakes hands on a $50,000 equipment deal, the buyer says "send me an invoice," and what follows is a 30-to-90-day accounts receivable cycle that often begins with someone typing the buyer's email address into a spreadsheet. Stripe Invoicing and similar tools allow exhibitors to generate and send a professional invoice from a mobile device in under 60 seconds, with built-in payment links that let the buyer pay by credit card, ACH transfer, or bank debit. The deal that used to take three months to close financially can now be settled before the exhibitor's flight home.</p>

            <h3>Subscription and Recurring Revenue Models</h3>
            <p>The most sophisticated exhibitors are not just selling products at trade shows &mdash; they are signing up customers for subscriptions, service contracts, and recurring software licenses. Stripe Billing powers the subscription infrastructure for companies across every industry, and exhibitors who integrate it into their show-floor workflow can convert a trade show conversation into a recurring revenue commitment with a few taps on a tablet.</p>

            <div class="stat-callout">
                <div class="stat-number">2.9% + 30&cent;</div>
                <div class="stat-label">Stripe's standard processing rate &mdash; typically 1-3 percentage points lower than trade-show-specific payment providers</div>
            </div>

            <h2>The Stablecoin Factor</h2>

            <p>One of the most intriguing dimensions of Stripe's recent trajectory is its aggressive push into stablecoins. The company recently acquired Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure platform, and Privy, a crypto wallet provider, to weave digital currency into its core payments business. For trade show exhibitors &mdash; particularly those operating internationally &mdash; this development could eliminate one of the most persistent headaches of global exhibition: currency conversion.</p>

            <p>Consider the pain of an American exhibitor selling products at a European trade show. The buyer pays in euros. The exhibitor's bank receives the payment in dollars after a 2-4 day settlement period, with a 2-3% currency conversion fee layered on top. Stablecoin-based settlement could reduce that friction to near zero: instant settlement, no conversion fees, no multi-day float. As Stripe integrates stablecoin rails into its payment links and invoicing tools, exhibitors operating across borders will have a genuine alternative to the traditional banking settlement process.</p>

            <h2>Show Organizers Are Already Moving</h2>

            <p>It is not just exhibitors who benefit from the payments revolution. Show organizers &mdash; the companies that sell exhibit space, manage registrations, and orchestrate the logistics of events with tens of thousands of attendees &mdash; are rapidly modernizing their payment infrastructure. Stripe was a featured exhibitor at NRF 2026, Retail's Big Show, and its own Stripe Sessions conference at Moscone West in San Francisco on April 29-30 has become a major event in its own right, attracting thousands of business leaders and developers.</p>

            <p>Progressive show organizers are using Stripe Connect to build marketplace-style payment systems where exhibitors, sponsors, and attendees can transact directly through the event platform, with the organizer collecting a platform fee on each transaction. This model transforms the show organizer from a passive landlord (renting floor space) into an active commerce facilitator (taking a percentage of every transaction that occurs at the event).</p>

            <blockquote>
                "The trade show of the future is not just an exhibition &mdash; it is a transaction platform. Every handshake should have a payment rail behind it, ready to convert intent into revenue in real time."
                <cite>&mdash; Payments Dive, Industry Analysis, 2026</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>What Exhibitors Should Do Now</h2>

            <h3>1. Audit Your Show-Floor Payment Workflow</h3>
            <p>Map every point in your trade show process where money changes hands or a financial commitment is made. Registration payments. Product sales. Demo-to-order conversions. Sponsorship invoicing. Lead retrieval purchases. Identify where friction exists &mdash; manual invoicing, slow settlement, high processing fees &mdash; and evaluate whether modern payment tools can eliminate it.</p>

            <h3>2. Equip Your Booth for Instant Transactions</h3>
            <p>If you sell products or take orders at trade shows, invest in mobile payment processing that works independently of convention center infrastructure. Stripe Terminal, Square, and similar solutions operate over cellular connections, eliminating dependence on unreliable venue Wi-Fi. Have payment links pre-loaded on tablets for your most common transaction types.</p>

            <h3>3. Integrate Payments with Lead Capture</h3>
            <p>The most powerful combination on the show floor is a lead capture system connected to a payment system. When an exhibitor can scan a badge, capture contact information, and process a transaction or send an invoice in a single workflow, the time from first conversation to first dollar shrinks from weeks to minutes. This integration is the highest-ROI technology investment an exhibitor can make.</p>

            <h3>4. Watch the Stablecoin Space for International Shows</h3>
            <p>If you exhibit internationally, monitor how Stripe and its competitors integrate stablecoin settlement into their tools. The exhibitor who can offer a European buyer instant, fee-free settlement in a stable digital currency will have a meaningful competitive advantage over one who quotes "net 30, plus currency conversion."</p>

            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <strong>Key Takeaway</strong>
                Stripe's $140 billion valuation is a bet on the future of commerce infrastructure &mdash; and the trade show industry is squarely in that future's path. Exhibitors who modernize their payment workflows, equip their booths for instant transactions, and integrate payments with lead capture will convert more show-floor conversations into revenue. The payments revolution is not coming to the show floor. It is already here. The only question is whether you are built to capture it.
