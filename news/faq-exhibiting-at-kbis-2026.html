<p>KBIS (Kitchen &amp; Bath Industry Show) is North America's largest trade show dedicated to kitchen and bath design. Held February 17-19, 2026 at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida, KBIS attracts over 30,000 design professionals and 600+ exhibitors.

<div class="faq-item"><h3>How do I ship materials to KBIS in Orlando?</h3><p>KBIS uses an official general services contractor for freight handling at the OCCC. Ship to the designated <strong>advance warehouse 2-3 weeks before the show</strong>, or arrange direct-to-show delivery during the move-in window. Drayage rates typically run $120 - $175 per CWT (per 100 lbs). The OCCC's loading docks are well-organized, but plan for the shared move-in schedule with IBS exhibitors.</p></div>

<div class="faq-item"><h3>Does KBIS offer lead retrieval systems?</h3><p>Yes. KBIS offers official lead retrieval scanners through its technology partner at <strong>$300 - $500 per unit</strong>.
