    <h2>Overview: Why Automate Is the Premier Stage for Robotics Networking</h2>
    <p>Automate 2026 returns to McCormick Place in Chicago from June 22 through 25, and it arrives at a moment when the robotics and automation industry is undergoing its most significant expansion in decades. Organized by the Association for Advancing Automation (A3), Automate has grown from a niche gathering of industrial robotics engineers into North America's largest automation event, drawing more than 35,000 attendees and over 800 exhibitors across robotics, machine vision, artificial intelligence, motion control, and related technologies.</p>
    <p>The show floor will span more than 300,000 square feet of McCormick Place's South Building, showcasing everything from collaborative robots and autonomous mobile platforms to advanced vision systems and AI-driven quality inspection tools. But for the professionals who attend year after year, the real value of Automate is not in watching demos. It is in the conversations that happen between sessions, over coffee in the concourse, and at dinners across Chicago's restaurant scene. This guide will help you make the most of every networking opportunity at Automate 2026.</p>

    <h2>Key Networking Events at Automate 2026</h2>
    <p><strong>Automate Conference Sessions.</strong> The multi-track conference program runs all four days and covers topics from warehouse automation and AI deployment to workforce development and safety standards. Each session draws a concentrated audience of professionals with shared interests, making the Q&amp;A periods and post-session mingle time exceptionally productive for targeted networking. Identify three to four sessions aligned with your business priorities and plan to arrive early enough to choose a seat near the aisle, where it is easier to introduce yourself to neighbors before the speaker begins.</p>
    <p><strong>A3 Welcome Reception.</strong> The official opening night reception on June 22 is one of the highest-value networking events of the entire show. Held in the McCormick Place event space, this gathering brings together exhibitors, attendees, speakers, and A3 leadership in a relaxed social setting before the intensity of the show floor begins. Conversations here tend to be broader and more exploratory than those that happen during the exhibition, making it an ideal place to identify potential partners and schedule deeper meetings for later in the week.</p>
    <p><strong>Innovation Stage Demos.</strong> Located on the show floor, the Innovation Stage hosts live demonstrations throughout each day. The crowds that gather around these demos create natural networking clusters. People watching the same demonstration share an instant conversation starter, and the breaks between demos are perfect moments to turn to the person next to you and exchange perspectives on what you just saw.</p>
    <p><strong>Startup Showcase and Pitch Competition.</strong> Automate's startup track attracts early-stage companies alongside the venture capitalists, corporate development teams, and integrators evaluating them. If you are a startup founder, this is where you build relationships with potential investors and channel partners. If you are a buyer or integrator, this is where you discover emerging technologies before your competitors do. The pitch sessions are followed by structured networking time specifically designed for participants to connect.</p>
    <p><strong>A3 Member Events and Committee Meetings.</strong> A3 hosts several member-only events and committee meetings during Automate week. If you are an A3 member or considering membership, these smaller gatherings offer access to industry leaders in an intimate setting that the main show floor cannot replicate. Committee meetings on topics like robot safety standards or vision-guided robotics attract highly specialized professionals who are deeply engaged in shaping the industry's future.</p>

    <h2>Best Networking Spots Inside and Outside the Venue</h2>
    <p><strong>McCormick Place South Concourse.</strong> The wide concourse connecting the exhibition halls is where tens of thousands of attendees pass throughout the day. The seating areas and coffee stations along this corridor become impromptu meeting spots. Many experienced Automate attendees intentionally schedule their informal meetings here rather than trying to talk over the noise of the show floor. Grab a seat near a charging station and you will find that people naturally gravitate toward open chairs and available outlets.</p>
    <p><strong>The Lakeside Center Terrace.</strong> Weather permitting, the outdoor areas overlooking Lake Michigan provide a welcome break from the enclosed exhibition halls. The change of scenery encourages more personal, less transactional conversations. If you are meeting someone for the first time, suggesting a walk to the lakeside terrace signals that you are interested in a real conversation rather than a quick sales pitch.</p>
    <p><strong>Hotel Lobbies at Hyatt Regency McCormick Place and Marriott Marquis.</strong> These two hotels connected to or adjacent to McCormick Place serve as secondary networking hubs. Their lobby bars and restaurants fill with Automate attendees from early morning through late evening. Many exhibitors book suites in these hotels specifically to host private meetings and small receptions away from the chaos of the show floor. If you are staying at either property, make a habit of spending thirty minutes in the lobby each morning and evening.</p>
    <p><strong>Chicago's West Loop and River North Districts.</strong> After the show floor closes, Automate's networking energy migrates into Chicago's restaurant and bar scene. The West Loop neighborhood, accessible by a short ride from McCormick Place, is packed with acclaimed restaurants like Girl and the Goat, Au Cheval, and Avec that attract industry crowds during Automate week. River North venues like RPM Italian and The Signature Room also draw show attendees. Check LinkedIn and the Automate app for unofficial evening events hosted by exhibitors at these locations.</p>

    <h2>Conversation Starters That Work at Automate</h2>
    <p>Automate attracts a technically sophisticated audience that values substance over small talk. Your conversation starters should reflect that.</p>
    <p><strong>At an exhibitor booth:</strong> "I have been following the shift from traditional industrial robots to cobots in mid-size manufacturing. How are your customers making that transition?" This shows you understand the industry landscape and invites the exhibitor to share real-world insights rather than recite marketing copy.</p>
    <p><strong>During a conference session break:</strong> "That presentation on AI-driven quality inspection was interesting, but I am curious how it works when the production environment changes frequently. What has been your experience?" This positions you as someone who thinks critically about implementation, which attracts the kind of thoughtful professionals who become valuable long-term contacts.</p>
    <p><strong>At the welcome reception:</strong> "Is this your first Automate, or have you been coming for a while? I am trying to figure out which sessions and areas of the floor are the highest priority this year." This works because veterans love sharing their expertise, and first-timers appreciate finding someone willing to compare notes.</p>
    <p><strong>Near the startup showcase:</strong> "I have been scouting for new automation solutions in the packaging space. Have you seen anything on the floor today that surprised you?" This invites recommendations, which naturally leads to exchanging contact information and comparing notes later.</p>
    <p>The key at an engineering-heavy show like Automate is to lead with curiosity about technical challenges rather than immediately pivoting to what you sell. The automation community is tight-knit, and people remember those who contributed genuine insight to a conversation.</p>

    <h2>Your Post-Automate Follow-Up Strategy</h2>
    <p>Four days at McCormick Place will produce dozens of conversations and a stack of business cards or scanned badges. Without a disciplined follow-up system, most of those connections will fade within a week. Here is how to prevent that.</p>
    <p><strong>During the show:</strong> After every meaningful conversation, capture a note immediately. Use a lead capture app like Scannly, the notes app on your phone, or even a voice memo. Record the person's name, company, what you discussed, and any specific follow-up you promised. By day three, conversations from day one will already be blurring together, and these notes become your lifeline.</p>
    <p><strong>Within 48 hours of the show closing:</strong> Send a personalized message to every contact worth pursuing. Reference something specific from your conversation. Instead of "great meeting you at Automate," try something like: "I really appreciated your perspective on deploying mobile robots in brownfield facilities during our conversation at the A3 reception. I have been thinking about the floor-marking challenge you mentioned, and I have a few ideas I would love to bounce off you."</p>
    <p><strong>Within two weeks:</strong> For your highest-priority contacts, propose a specific next step. A twenty-minute video call, a product walkthrough, an introduction to a colleague in your network who can help with the challenge they described. Be concrete about the value you are offering and connect it directly to something they told you at the show.</p>
    <p><strong>Quarterly nurture:</strong> Add your Automate contacts to a CRM or tracking spreadsheet and set calendar reminders to check in every quarter. Share a relevant article about automation trends, congratulate them on a company milestone, or simply ask how the project they mentioned at Automate is progressing. Consistent, low-pressure touchpoints keep you in their network so that when an opportunity emerges, you are already a trusted contact.</p>
    <p>Automate 2026 will be a landmark event for the robotics and automation industry. The attendees who leave Chicago with the most valuable networks will not be those who visited the most booths or collected the most badges. They will be the ones who had fewer, deeper conversations and followed through with the discipline to turn those conversations into lasting professional relationships. Plan ahead, show up with genuine curiosity, and treat every interaction as the beginning of a relationship rather than a transaction.</p>
