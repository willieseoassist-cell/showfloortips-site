<p>AHR Expo is the world's largest HVACR event, bringing together over 60,000 professionals and 1,800+ exhibitors. Whether you are a first-time exhibitor or a returning company, this FAQ covers the most common questions about exhibiting at AHR Expo 2026 in Las Vegas.</p>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How much does booth space cost at AHR Expo 2026?</h3>
<p>Booth space at AHR Expo 2026 costs <strong>$46.20 per square foot</strong>. A standard 10x10 booth is $4,620, a 10x20 is $9,240, and a 20x20 island is $18,480. Spaces are divided by drapes, with all other booth materials, furnishings, electrical, and internet purchased separately through the official show services contractor. Early commitment often secures better floor placement.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>When and where is AHR Expo 2026?</h3>
<p>AHR Expo 2026 is held at the <strong>Las Vegas Convention Center</strong> in Las Vegas, Nevada. The show runs for three days, typically in late January or early February. AHR Expo alternates between cities each year, with previous editions in Chicago, Orlando, and Atlanta. Check <a href="https://www.ahrexpo.com">ahrexpo.com</a> for the latest schedule and dates.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What is the exhibitor registration deadline?</h3>
<p>AHR Expo typically opens exhibitor registration <strong>8-10 months</strong> before the show. Early bird pricing and preferred booth locations require registration 6+ months in advance. The best locations fill quickly due to returning exhibitor priority. Contact the AHR Expo sales team directly for specific deadlines, available space, and pricing for your booth size.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How do I ship my booth materials and equipment?</h3>
<p>AHR Expo designates an official general services contractor (typically GES or Freeman) for all freight and drayage. You will receive shipping instructions in your exhibitor kit, including warehouse addresses and target delivery windows. <strong>Advance warehouse shipments</strong> are typically due 2-3 weeks before the show. Direct-to-show shipments are accepted during designated move-in windows. Expect drayage rates of $140-$200 per CWT (per 100 lbs). Ship early to avoid overtime surcharges.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What hotels are near the Las Vegas Convention Center?</h3>
<p>Several hotels are within walking distance or a short shuttle ride from the LVCC. The <strong>Westgate Las Vegas</strong> is directly adjacent via monorail. Other nearby options include the Las Vegas Marriott, Renaissance Las Vegas, and various Strip hotels accessible via the Las Vegas Monorail. AHR Expo negotiates discounted room blocks through its official housing partner. Rates typically run <strong>$150-$350 per night</strong> during the show. Book early, as discounted blocks sell out months in advance.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How many exhibitor badges are included with my booth?</h3>
<p>AHR Expo provides complimentary exhibitor badges based on booth size. A standard 10x10 booth typically includes <strong>4-6 exhibitor badges</strong>, with larger booths receiving proportionally more. Additional badges can be purchased through the exhibitor portal. All booth staff must be registered and wear visible badges during show hours. Exhibitor badges provide access to the show floor during setup, show hours, and teardown.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What are the setup and teardown schedules?</h3>
<p>Exhibitor move-in typically begins <strong>2-3 days before the show opens</strong>. Standard setup hours are 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, with extended hours available for an additional fee. Small booth exhibitors (10x10) may have a more limited move-in window than large island booths. <strong>Move-out begins immediately</strong> after the show closes on the final day. All materials must be removed within 24 hours. Early teardown before the show officially closes is prohibited and may result in penalties.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What lead retrieval options are available?</h3>
<p>AHR Expo offers official lead retrieval scanners through its technology partner at <strong>$300-$500 per scanner</strong>. These devices scan attendee badges to capture contact information, company data, and product interests. Data is exported as a CSV file after the show. For a more advanced solution, <a href="/scannly.html">Scannly</a> provides AI-powered badge scanning with automated lead qualification and follow-up capabilities.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Is there parking available at the Las Vegas Convention Center?</h3>
<p>The LVCC has on-site parking available on a first-come, first-served basis at <strong>$15-$20 per day</strong>. During major shows, parking fills early. The Las Vegas Monorail has a station at the LVCC, providing easy access from Strip hotels. Rideshare (Uber/Lyft) drop-off zones are located near the main entrances. For exhibitors with early morning setup, arriving before 7:30 AM typically ensures a parking spot.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What types of companies exhibit at AHR Expo?</h3>

Exhibitors include manufacturers of <strong>HVAC systems, refrigeration equipment, building automation controls, plumbing fixtures, indoor air quality products, tools, software, and energy efficiency solutions</strong>.
