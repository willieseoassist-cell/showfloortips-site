    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Healthcare professionals looking to exhibit, network, or source new technology in 2026 have two heavyweight options on the global calendar: HIMSS (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society) Global Health Conference and Arab Health. Both are massive, both attract international audiences, and both can deliver significant ROI. But they serve distinctly different audiences, operate in very different markets, and demand different strategies to attend successfully.</p>
    <p>HIMSS 2026 takes place March 9-13 in Las Vegas at the Venetian Convention and Expo Center, focusing on health information technology, digital health, and clinical informatics. Arab Health 2026, the largest healthcare trade show in the Middle East, ran January 27-30 at the Dubai World Trade Centre, covering the full spectrum of medical devices, equipment, and healthcare services. If you missed Arab Health this year, this comparison will still help you plan for 2027 and benchmark it against HIMSS.</p>
    <p>This guide provides a detailed comparison across every dimension that matters: audience, scale, cost, logistics, and what each show is best suited for.</p>

    </table>

    <h2>Audience: Who Attends Each Show?</h2>
    <p><strong>HIMSS</strong> draws a highly specialized audience. The majority of attendees are CIOs, CTOs, CMIOs, and IT directors from hospital systems, health plans, and government health agencies. You will also find a significant presence of electronic health record (EHR) vendors, cybersecurity firms, cloud infrastructure providers, and AI/machine learning companies targeting healthcare. The audience skews heavily toward the United States, though international attendance has grown steadily, with delegations from Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific. If your product or service is a digital health solution, interoperability platform, clinical decision support tool, or healthcare cybersecurity offering, HIMSS is where your buyers gather.</p>
    <p><strong>Arab Health</strong> casts a far wider net. The attendee base spans the full healthcare ecosystem: hospital administrators, procurement officers, clinicians, biomedical engineers, laboratory professionals, and government health ministry officials. The geographic mix leans toward the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, and Central Asia, though European and American companies exhibit heavily. Arab Health is particularly strong for medical devices, imaging equipment, diagnostics, laboratory technology, and hospital furniture and infrastructure. If you are a medical device manufacturer looking to expand into emerging markets across the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia, Arab Health offers unparalleled access to decision-makers in those regions.</p>

    <h2>Location and Logistics</h2>
    <p><strong>HIMSS in Las Vegas</strong> benefits from the city's world-class convention infrastructure. The Venetian Convention and Expo Center offers a modern, climate-controlled venue with excellent connectivity and walkability. Hotels are abundant and range from budget to luxury, though rates spike during HIMSS week. McCarran International Airport (now Harry Reid International) offers direct flights from nearly every major U.S. city and many international hubs. The downside: Las Vegas can be overwhelming and distracting, and the desert setting means stepping outside the convention center offers little beyond strip malls and casinos.</p>
    <p><strong>Arab Health in Dubai</strong> takes place at the Dubai World Trade Centre, a centrally located venue with easy access via the Dubai Metro (Trade Centre station). Dubai is one of the world's best-connected aviation hubs, with Emirates and flydubai offering direct flights from virtually every continent. Hotels in the area range from mid-range to ultra-luxury. The city itself offers a dramatically different experience from Las Vegas: world-class dining, cultural attractions, and a business culture that blends Gulf, South Asian, and Western influences. Visitors should be aware of local customs, including modest dress expectations and restrictions on alcohol consumption outside licensed venues.</p>
    <p>For U.S.-based attendees, HIMSS is obviously more convenient. For companies targeting international markets, particularly in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia, Arab Health's Dubai location puts you closer to your customers and reduces travel friction for the buyers you most want to meet.</p>

    <h2>Cost Comparison</h2>
    <p><strong>HIMSS registration</strong> is a significant investment. A full conference pass runs between $1,295 and $2,395 depending on membership status and registration timing. Exhibit hall-only passes are available for free with promotional codes, but you miss the education sessions and many networking events. Exhibitor booth costs start around $4,500 for a small booth and scale rapidly for larger spaces. Factor in Las Vegas hotel rates during convention week ($200 to $500 per night), flights, and meals, and a typical attendee should budget $3,000 to $5,000 for the week. Exhibitors with a small booth and a two-person team can expect to spend $15,000 to $30,000 all in.</p>
    <p><strong>Arab Health visitor registration</strong> is free, which is a major differentiator. Conference session passes vary in price but are significantly less expensive than HIMSS. Exhibitor booth costs are competitive, starting around $5,000 for a shell scheme booth in a standard hall. Dubai hotel rates are comparable to Las Vegas during the show ($150 to $400 per night), though the longer flight from North America adds to airfare costs. A U.S.-based attendee should budget $4,000 to $7,000 for the trip including flights, while exhibitors can expect $20,000 to $40,000 depending on booth size and team.</p>
    <p>For companies on a tight budget, Arab Health's free registration makes it more accessible for attendees who want to scout the market without committing to a full conference pass. HIMSS, however, delivers higher-value networking opportunities in its paid education sessions and is more cost-effective for U.S.-based companies that save on international airfare.</p>

    <h2>Verdict: Which Show Is Right for You?</h2>
    <p><strong>Choose HIMSS 2026 if:</strong> Your product or service is in the health IT, digital health, cybersecurity, interoperability, or AI space. Your primary market is the United States, and your target buyers are CIOs, CTOs, and IT decision-makers at hospital systems and health plans. HIMSS is the undisputed leader in health technology, and the depth of the audience in this niche is unmatched anywhere in the world. The education program is also excellent for staying current on regulatory changes, standards like FHIR and TEFCA, and emerging technology trends.</p>
    <p><strong>Choose Arab Health if:</strong> You manufacture or distribute medical devices, imaging equipment, laboratory technology, or hospital infrastructure. Your target markets include the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, or you are looking to expand internationally. Arab Health's broader product scope and geographic diversity make it ideal for companies seeking to establish distribution partnerships, meet government procurement officials, or enter new markets. The show's sheer scale and the diversity of its attendee base create opportunities that no single Western trade show can replicate.</p>
    <p><strong>Attend both if:</strong> You are a large healthcare company with both a technology portfolio and a medical device or equipment line. Many global players like Siemens Healthineers, Philips, GE HealthCare, and Medtronic exhibit at both events because the audiences are complementary rather than overlapping. HIMSS gives you depth in the U.S. health IT market; Arab Health gives you breadth across the global healthcare equipment landscape.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, the right choice depends on what you sell, who you sell it to, and where your growth markets are. Both shows deliver exceptional value for the right attendee. The worst decision is to attend the wrong one and wonder why your booth was empty or your meetings felt off-target. Match your show to your strategy, and the ROI will follow.</p>
