<h1>Networking Guide: Your Complete Playbook for Automate 2026 in Chicago</h1>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581091226825-a6a2a5aee158?w=1920&q=80" alt="Industrial manufacturing and robotics technology at Automate trade show" loading="lazy">

<h2>Show Overview</h2>
<p>Automate 2026 lands at McCormick Place in Chicago from June 22 to 25, and it is shaping up to be the biggest edition yet. North America's largest automation trade show drew a record 45,000 registrants in 2025 and expects to surpass that number this year with more than 1,000 exhibitors spread across 450,000-plus square feet of floor space in McCormick Place's North and South Halls.</p>
<p>The show covers the full spectrum of manufacturing automation: robotics, artificial intelligence, machine vision, motion control, sensors, and emerging technologies like humanoid robots. A new NVIDIA-sponsored Humanoid Robot Pavilion and the returning Humanoid Robot Forum underscore how rapidly this industry is evolving. Best of all, show floor registration is free, making Automate one of the most accessible major trade events on the 2026 calendar.</p>

<h2>Pre-Show Preparation</h2>
<h3>Research Exhibitors</h3>
<p>The Automate exhibitor directory goes live months before the show and is searchable by product category, company name, and booth location. With over 1,000 exhibitors, you cannot visit them all. Start by identifying the 20 companies most relevant to your automation challenges or sales targets. Cross-reference this list with the conference session speakers -- a VP of robotics delivering a keynote is someone worth meeting on the show floor.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to the pavilions and themed areas. The Humanoid Robot Pavilion, the AI Zone, and the Vision and Imaging area each concentrate specific types of vendors. Planning your route by zone saves time and ensures you cover your priority categories systematically.</p>

<h3>Set Meetings Early</h3>
<p>Automate attracts plant managers, automation engineers, C-suite manufacturing leaders, and systems integrators. These are busy people with packed schedules. Reach out via LinkedIn or email at least four weeks before the show. Reference a specific product, demo, or session they are involved with. Aim for six to ten confirmed meetings before you arrive in Chicago.</p>
<p>Use the official Automate app and meeting scheduler to book time slots with exhibitors. Many exhibitors offer private demonstration appointments that are far more valuable than a five-minute booth conversation during peak traffic.</p>

<h3>LinkedIn and Social Outreach</h3>
<p>Follow the Automate Show accounts on LinkedIn and Twitter. Engage with pre-show content -- comment on exhibitor announcements, share the sessions you plan to attend, and use the official event hashtag. This visibility makes your name familiar to people you will meet in person. Update your LinkedIn headline to mention Automate 2026 and your specific areas of interest, such as "Exploring collaborative robotics solutions at Automate 2026."</p>

<h2>Day-of Networking Tactics</h2>
<h3>Best Times to Approach</h3>
<p>The show floor opens at 10:00 AM on Monday, June 22, but the real action starts with keynote sessions in the morning. The transition periods between keynotes and the show floor opening are prime networking windows. People are energized by what they just heard and eager to discuss applications.</p>
<p>Midday between 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM is excellent for booth visits, as exhibitors are fully staffed and demonstrations are running at peak performance. The last hour before the floor closes tends to be quieter, which is ideal for longer, more technical conversations with booth engineers who finally have breathing room.</p>

<h3>Conversation Starters</h3>
<p>Automate attendees are technical and practical. Skip generic openers and lead with specifics: "We are running a pick-and-place line that struggles with mixed SKUs -- how does your vision system handle that?" or "I saw your demo of the collaborative welding arm -- what is the typical integration timeline?" Engineers and product managers light up when you demonstrate that you understand the problem their product solves.</p>

<h3>Booth Etiquette</h3>
<p>Many Automate booths feature live robot demonstrations that draw crowds. Wait for a natural break in the demo cycle before engaging booth staff. If you are interested in a specific technical capability, ask to speak with an applications engineer rather than a sales representative. At a show this technical, the deeper you can go in a conversation, the more memorable you become.</p>
<p>If you are exhibiting, run your demos on a regular schedule and post the times visibly. This gives attendees a reason to return and gives your team structured breaks between presentations.</p>

<h2>After-Hours Events and Unofficial Meetups</h2>
<p>Automate's official networking reception is held on the show floor on the first evening and is included with registration. The atmosphere is casual, the drinks are flowing, and the setting -- surrounded by robots and automation equipment -- provides endless conversation starters.</p>
<p>Beyond the official event, Chicago's dining and nightlife scene around McCormick Place and the South Loop offers plenty of options for informal gatherings. Major exhibitors like FANUC, ABB, Universal Robots, and Rockwell Automation typically host customer appreciation dinners and private events. If you are a current or prospective customer, reach out to your sales contact for an invitation.</p>
<p>The Association for Advancing Automation (A3), which organizes Automate, also runs committee meetings and special interest group sessions during the week. These smaller gatherings attract industry leaders working on standards, safety, and emerging technology roadmaps. Attending these sessions positions you as a serious industry participant, not just a show attendee.</p>

<h2>Follow-Up Strategy</h2>
<h3>The 48-Hour Rule</h3>
<p>Manufacturing automation sales cycles are long, but first impressions fade fast. Send your follow-up emails within 48 hours. Reference the specific robot model, software platform, or integration challenge you discussed. If a booth engineer drew a diagram on a whiteboard to explain their approach, mention that detail. Specificity signals that you are a serious buyer, not a tire-kicker.</p>

<h3>CRM Tips</h3>
<p>Log every booth visit and meeting with notes about the conversation, the products discussed, and the agreed-upon next steps. Tag leads by stage: information gathering, evaluation, ready for quote, or partnership discussion. Set reminders for 7-day, 30-day, and 90-day follow-ups, because automation purchasing decisions often involve multiple stakeholders and lengthy approval processes.</p>

<h3>Post-Show Content</h3>
<p>Write a LinkedIn post or internal report summarizing the top trends you observed at Automate 2026. Tagging the companies and people you met keeps the conversation alive. If you took photos or videos of demonstrations (with permission), share them with your engineering team to spark internal discussions about automation opportunities.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skipping the conference sessions.</strong> The keynotes and technical sessions are free with registration. They feature plant managers and engineers sharing real-world automation case studies that directly inform buying decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Spending all your time in one hall.</strong> McCormick Place is massive. Plan your route to cover both the North and South Halls, and budget time for transitions between buildings.</li>
<li><strong>Not wearing comfortable shoes.</strong> You will walk 15,000 to 20,000 steps per day on concrete floors. Blisters on day one will ruin your networking on days two through four.</li>
<li><strong>Collecting brochures instead of contacts.</strong> A stack of product catalogs does nothing for your pipeline. Focus on capturing contact information and scheduling follow-up calls.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring the startup and emerging technology areas.</strong> Some of the most innovative solutions come from smaller companies that do not have massive booths. Walk the aisles beyond the anchor exhibitors.</li>
<li><strong>Failing to qualify leads.</strong> Not every booth visitor or contact is a real prospect. Spend your limited post-show follow-up energy on the 20 percent of contacts who represent 80 percent of the opportunity.</li>
</ul>
