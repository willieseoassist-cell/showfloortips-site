    <p>Eli Lilly just announced it is acquiring <strong>Orna Therapeutics for $2.4 billion</strong> in cash, adding the biotech's cutting-edge circular RNA and in-vivo cell engineering platform to its pipeline. The deal is the latest in what is shaping up to be the most active pharma M&amp;A year since 2023, when Pfizer's $45.6 billion acquisition of Seagen set the benchmark. For healthcare trade show exhibitors, the message is unmistakable: the conference floor is now a deal floor, and 2026 is the year to be there.</p>

    <p>The Orna acquisition comes as Lilly projects <strong>$80 billion to $83 billion</strong> in forecasted 2026 sales, driven by its dominance in the obesity and diabetes space. That financial firepower is fueling an acquisition strategy aimed at building next-generation capabilities in genetic medicine — and it is far from finished.</p>

    <h2>A Wave of Pharma Deals Is Reshaping the Industry</h2>

    <p>Lilly's move is not an isolated event. Earlier in January, Merck was in talks to acquire cancer-focused biotech Revolution Medicines in a deal that could have reached $32 billion. While those negotiations ultimately collapsed over valuation disagreements — Merck was initially interested at over $28 billion, but Revolution insisted on a higher price — the fact that a deal of that magnitude was on the table reveals the scale of pharma's acquisition appetite in 2026.</p>

    <p>Merck is under particular pressure, facing patent losses expected to erode $18 billion in sales over the next five years. That urgency to replenish the pipeline through acquisition is shared across the industry. Analysts at Sherwood News reported that big pharma entered 2026 "with an appetite for deals," and the data confirms it: healthcare M&amp;A deal value in January 2026 exceeded $15 billion, according to Lawrence, Evans &amp; Co.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the FTC reached a settlement with pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts over its role in high insulin prices, requiring changes that will lower out-of-pocket costs for patients and save money for government programs. Novo Nordisk sued Hims &amp; Hers over Wegovy patent infringement, and Hims &amp; Hers subsequently retreated from plans to sell a cheaper copycat version of the weight-loss drug. These regulatory and legal battles are adding urgency to every pharma company's competitive positioning.</p>

    <h2>Why Healthcare Trade Shows Are the M&amp;A Epicenter</h2>

    <p>The pharma deal pipeline does not materialize out of thin air. It is built through relationships forged at industry events. <a href="https://www.himss.org/global-health-conference-exhibition" target="_blank">HIMSS 2026</a> (March 3-6 in Las Vegas) is the first major healthcare technology event of the spring calendar, and this year's conference will carry an unmistakable M&amp;A undercurrent. With health IT companies increasingly becoming acquisition targets for pharma giants looking to add digital capabilities, HIMSS is where those initial conversations often begin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.bio.org/events/bio-international-convention" target="_blank">BIO International Convention 2026</a> (June 2-5 in Boston) is the industry's premier partnering event, with over 50,000 scheduled one-on-one meetings in a typical year. In an M&amp;A-heavy environment, BIO's structured partnering platform becomes even more valuable — it is where biotech companies like Orna Therapeutics first build the visibility that leads to billion-dollar offers.</p>

    <p>For smaller biotech exhibitors, the lesson from the Orna deal is clear: <strong>your trade show presence is your acquisition pipeline.</strong> Orna's circular RNA platform attracted Lilly's attention precisely because it had built visibility in the genetic medicine space through conference presentations, poster sessions, and exhibition presence at events like the American Society of Gene &amp; Cell Therapy annual meeting.</p>

    <h2>The Obesity Drug Wars and Their Trade Show Footprint</h2>

    <p>The Lilly-Orna deal must be understood in the context of the broader obesity drug market, which is driving unprecedented financial performance across pharma. Lilly's $80-83 billion sales forecast is anchored by its GLP-1 drugs, while Novo Nordisk — its primary competitor — has issued a starkly different outlook, projecting that sales and profit will drop by 5% and 13% respectively in 2026.</p>

    <p>This divergence is creating two very different exhibitor strategies at healthcare trade shows. Lilly is investing aggressively in booth presence, sponsorship, and satellite symposia at events like the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meeting. Novo Nordisk, by contrast, is defending market share while simultaneously fighting patent battles.</p>

    <p>For medical device and diagnostic companies exhibiting at shows like <a href="https://www.medica.de/" target="_blank">MEDICA</a> (November, Dusseldorf) and <a href="https://www.arabhealthonline.com/" target="_blank">Arab Health</a> (January, Dubai), the obesity drug boom creates indirect opportunities. The patient monitoring, surgical, and diagnostic technologies that support obesity treatment protocols are seeing surging demand, and these trade shows are where purchasing decisions are made.</p>

    <h2>What Exhibitors Should Do Now</h2>

    <p>For companies planning their healthcare <a href="/guide.html">trade show strategy</a> in 2026, the M&amp;A wave creates specific opportunities and risks.</p>

    <p><strong>Biotech companies seeking acquisition:</strong> Maximize your visibility at BIO International, the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference (which just concluded in January), and disease-specific specialty conferences. Your booth is your storefront. Make sure your data presentation is investor-grade, not just clinician-grade.</p>

    <p><strong>Medical device exhibitors:</strong> The Lilly/Orna deal and the obesity drug wars are driving massive capital allocation in pharma. That capital will flow downstream to device companies, diagnostics, and health IT. Position your booth messaging around the therapeutic areas where pharma is investing most aggressively.</p>

    <p><strong>Health IT companies:</strong> Digital health is increasingly an acquisition category, not just a product category. If you are exhibiting at <a href="https://www.himss.org/" target="_blank">HIMSS</a> or <a href="https://www.vivatech.com/" target="_blank">VivaTech</a>, ensure your business development team is staffing the booth alongside your product team. The next $2.4 billion deal could start with a conversation at your demo station.</p>

    <p>The pharma M&amp;A cycle tends to accelerate once it begins, and by all indications, 2026 is accelerating. Use your <a href="/roi-calculator.html">trade show ROI calculator</a> to evaluate where the highest-value meetings are happening — then make sure you are in the room.</p>
