        <div class="article-body">
            <p>Posidonia 2026 is the maritime industry's most prestigious gathering, bringing together more than 22,000 shipping professionals and roughly 2,000 exhibitors from over 90 countries to the Athens Metropolitan Expo from June 1 through 5. Held biennially since 1969, Posidonia is not merely a trade show. It is the event where the global shipping community renews relationships, signs contracts, announces newbuilding orders, and sets the strategic direction for an industry that moves 90 percent of the world's trade. If you work in shipping, shipbuilding, maritime technology, port operations, marine insurance, or any segment of the blue economy, Posidonia represents the single most important networking opportunity in your calendar cycle. This guide will help you navigate the unique dynamics of this deeply relationship-driven event and leave Athens with connections that can define your career and your business for years to come.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Show Preparation: Building Your Strategy Before Athens</h2>
            <p>Posidonia operates differently from most trade shows. The maritime industry is built on personal relationships, family legacies, and trust that develops over decades rather than quarters. Walking onto the exhibition floor without a plan, without scheduled meetings, and without an understanding of who will be there is a mistake that marks you as an outsider in a community that values preparation and professionalism. Start planning at least six weeks before June 1.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Define your networking objectives with maritime specificity.</strong> The shipping industry is vast and segmented. Are you a shipyard representative looking to connect with Greek shipowners for newbuilding contracts? A maritime technology startup seeking pilot programs with major fleet operators? A classification society surveyor building relationships with technical managers? A marine fuel supplier positioning for the IMO 2030 emissions targets? Write down your top three goals and map them to the specific types of companies and individuals who will be at Posidonia. The more precisely you define your targets, the more effectively you will use your five days in Athens.</li>
                <li><strong>Study the exhibitor list and identify priority companies.</strong> Posidonia draws the full spectrum of the maritime ecosystem. Major shipyards from South Korea, China, Japan, and Europe will have prominent pavilions. Classification societies including DNV, Lloyd's Register, Bureau Veritas, ClassNK, and the American Bureau of Shipping maintain large stands and host invitation-only events. Engine manufacturers like MAN Energy Solutions and WinGD will demonstrate next-generation propulsion technology. Maritime technology companies ranging from satellite communications providers to digital twin platforms will fill entire halls. National pavilions from Greece, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, China, the Netherlands, and dozens of other maritime nations create concentrated clusters of companies organized by country. Study the floor plan and rank your priority exhibitors before you arrive.</li>
                <li><strong>Schedule meetings through your existing network first.</strong> In the maritime industry, warm introductions carry far more weight than cold approaches. Reach out to your existing contacts and ask who they can introduce you to at Posidonia. Greek shipowners, in particular, are famously accessible to people who come through trusted referrals and notoriously guarded with strangers who approach them cold on the exhibition floor. If you have a relationship with a classification society surveyor, a ship broker, or a maritime lawyer, ask them to facilitate introductions to their clients and counterparts.</li>
                <li><strong>Register for invitation-only events early.</strong> Many of Posidonia's most valuable networking moments happen at events that require advance registration or personal invitations. The Greek Shipping Awards ceremony, organized by Lloyd's List, brings together the most senior leaders in the Greek and international shipping community for a formal dinner. Classification societies and major exhibitors host private receptions, typically on the second and third evenings of the show. National pavilion events, particularly those hosted by the Norwegian, Dutch, and Singaporean delegations, are excellent for meeting concentrated groups of companies from those maritime clusters. Start requesting invitations as soon as they become available.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare for the Posidonia Games.</strong> The Posidonia Running Event and other athletic activities organized alongside the exhibition are a distinctive feature of this show. The running event draws hundreds of maritime professionals for a morning race through Athens, and the camaraderie of shared physical effort creates bonds that no amount of business card exchange can replicate. If you are physically active, register for the Posidonia Games and use the training period and the event itself as networking opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Book your Athens accommodations strategically.</strong> The Athens Metropolitan Expo is located near Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, roughly 30 kilometers east of central Athens. Many Posidonia attendees stay in the Glyfada, Vouliagmeni, or Syntagma Square areas. Piraeus, the historic port city that serves as the operational headquarters of Greek shipping, is another strategic lodging choice. Staying near Piraeus puts you close to the offices of major Greek shipowners and within walking distance of the waterfront restaurants where evening networking happens naturally. The Athens Metro connects the airport area, central Athens, and Piraeus efficiently, but taxis and ride-sharing during Posidonia week become scarce and expensive. Plan your transportation in advance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Exhibitors and Industry Players at Posidonia 2026</h2>
            <p>Understanding who exhibits at Posidonia and what they represent in the maritime ecosystem will help you navigate the show floor with purpose and context.</p>

            <h3>Greek Shipowners and Operators</h3>
            <p>Greece controls approximately 21 percent of the world's merchant fleet by deadweight tonnage, making it the largest shipowning nation on earth. The families and companies behind this dominance, names like Angelicoussis, Marinakis, Procopiou, Tsakos, Economou, Laskaridis, and Livanos, are the gravitational center of Posidonia. Many of these shipowners do not exhibit in the traditional sense. They attend as buyers, investors, and decision-makers, moving through the exhibition halls with entourages and attending private meetings in VIP lounges and hospitality suites. Gaining access to these individuals typically requires an introduction through a trusted intermediary such as a ship broker, a maritime lawyer, or a classification society relationship manager. If your business depends on reaching Greek shipowners, invest your pre-show preparation in securing warm introductions.</p>

            <h3>Major Shipyards</h3>
            <p>Posidonia is where newbuilding contracts are discussed, negotiated, and sometimes announced. HD Hyundai Heavy Industries, Samsung Heavy Industries, and Hanwha Ocean from South Korea maintain substantial pavilions. Chinese state-owned yards including CSSC and Yangzijiang Shipbuilding send large delegations. Japanese builders such as Imabari Shipbuilding and Japan Marine United are present through the Japan pavilion. European specialists like Fincantieri and Damen Shipyards showcase advanced vessel designs. These shipyard pavilions are some of the busiest meeting points on the floor, and appointment calendars fill up weeks before the show opens.</p>

            <h3>Classification Societies</h3>
            <p>DNV, Lloyd's Register, Bureau Veritas, ClassNK, the American Bureau of Shipping, and other classification societies play a central role at Posidonia. Their stands function as networking hubs because every shipowner, shipyard, and equipment manufacturer needs relationships with class societies. DNV and Lloyd's Register, in particular, host well-attended receptions and technical seminars that draw senior technical managers and fleet directors. If you are new to the maritime industry, classification society events are excellent starting points for building your network because the attendees span every segment of shipping.</p>

            <h3>Maritime Technology Companies</h3>
            <p>The maritime technology sector has expanded dramatically at Posidonia in recent editions. Companies offering fleet management software, predictive maintenance platforms, autonomous shipping solutions, emissions monitoring systems, cybersecurity services, and digital twin technology fill dedicated technology halls. Startups and scale-ups from maritime innovation hubs in Norway, the Netherlands, Singapore, and Israel bring cutting-edge solutions that attract forward-thinking shipowners and technical managers. The technology halls tend to have a different energy than the traditional maritime equipment sections, with more open demonstration formats and a greater willingness to engage in exploratory conversations.</p>

            <h3>Marine Equipment and Services</h3>
            <p>Hundreds of exhibitors provide the engines, propellers, coatings, ballast water treatment systems, scrubbers, navigation systems, communication equipment, and countless other products that keep the world's fleet operating. Companies like Wartsila, Alfa Laval, Kongsberg Maritime, Hempel, and Jotun have established Posidonia presences that their clients expect and rely upon. National pavilions from manufacturing nations like Germany, Finland, and Denmark concentrate marine equipment suppliers in easily navigable clusters.</p>

            <h2>Networking Events: Where Relationships Are Built at Posidonia</h2>
            <p>Posidonia is famous for the quality and quantity of its networking events. The exhibition floor is important, but the events surrounding it are where the deepest relationships form.</p>

            <h3>The Greek Shipping Awards</h3>
            <p>Organized by Lloyd's List, the Greek Shipping Awards ceremony is the social highlight of Posidonia week. This formal black-tie dinner brings together the most influential figures in Greek and international shipping to recognize achievement across categories including Shipowner of the Year, Shipbroker of the Year, and the Lloyd's List Intelligence Big Data Award. Tickets are expensive and tables sell out months in advance, but attending this event places you in a room with the highest concentration of maritime decision-making power anywhere in the world. If you can secure an invitation, this is the single most valuable networking event of the week. Dress code is strictly black tie, and the event typically runs late into the evening with extended post-ceremony mingling.</p>

            <h3>The Posidonia Games</h3>
            <p>The Posidonia Running Event and associated athletic activities have become a beloved tradition. The running event, typically held on a weekend morning before the exhibition opens, draws hundreds of participants from the maritime community for a scenic race through Athens. The shared experience of running alongside shipowners, classification society executives, and equipment manufacturers creates a unique bonding environment that the exhibition floor cannot replicate. Participants often gather afterward for breakfast and drinks, and the informal atmosphere makes it easy to approach people you might never reach during the structured business hours of the show. Even if you are not a competitive runner, the event welcomes all fitness levels and the social benefits far outweigh the physical effort.</p>

            <h3>Evening Receptions and Private Events</h3>
            <p>Every evening of Posidonia week, dozens of receptions, dinners, and parties take place across Athens. Classification societies host client appreciation events at rooftop venues with Acropolis views. National pavilions organize receptions featuring their country's cuisine and culture. Major exhibitors invite key clients and prospects to dinners at Athens' finest restaurants. Shipping associations like BIMCO, INTERCARGO, and INTERTANKO hold member events. The Union of Greek Shipowners and the Hellenic Chamber of Shipping organize gatherings that attract the domestic industry leadership. Your goal should be to attend at least one evening event each night of the show. These events are where the formal barriers of the exhibition floor dissolve and genuine personal connections form over food, wine, and conversation.</p>

            <h3>Conference and Seminar Programme</h3>
            <p>Posidonia's conference programme addresses the most pressing issues facing the maritime industry, from decarbonization and alternative fuels to digitalization, autonomous shipping, and geopolitical disruption of trade routes. Panel discussions and keynote sessions draw senior executives who are willing to share their perspectives publicly, making it easy to identify potential contacts and approach them with informed questions after their presentations. The Q&A periods are particularly valuable. Asking a thoughtful question during a panel session makes you visible to the entire audience and gives the speaker a reason to remember you when you approach them afterward.</p>

            <h2>Navigating Greek Business Customs</h2>
            <p>Greek shipping culture has its own rhythms, values, and social norms that differ significantly from the business cultures of Northern Europe, North America, or Asia. Understanding these customs will dramatically improve your effectiveness at Posidonia.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relationships precede transactions.</strong> Greek shipowners are legendary for their loyalty to trusted partners, sometimes maintaining relationships with the same suppliers and service providers across generations. They are correspondingly skeptical of new entrants who lead with a sales pitch. At Posidonia, your first conversation with a Greek shipping professional should be about building rapport, not closing a deal. Ask about their fleet, their history in shipping, their perspective on market conditions. Show genuine interest in their business before you discuss your own.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect the family dimension.</strong> Many of the largest Greek shipping companies are family-owned and family-managed, with second and third generations now at the helm. Family names carry enormous weight in the Greek maritime community, and understanding the lineage and reputation of a shipping family is as important as understanding their fleet composition. Do your research before the show so you can demonstrate informed respect when meeting members of prominent shipping families.</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace the pace of Greek hospitality.</strong> Business meetings in Greece often run longer than scheduled and may include coffee, conversation about non-business topics, and a general rhythm that prioritizes personal connection over agenda efficiency. If a Greek host invites you for coffee, expect the meeting to last at least 45 minutes to an hour, even if you only have one agenda item. Rushing through the social portion of a meeting to get to business is considered rude and will undermine the relationship you are trying to build.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn basic Greek greetings.</strong> While English is widely spoken in the Greek shipping community, a few words of Greek go a long way. Saying "kalimera" (good morning), "kalispera" (good evening), "efcharisto" (thank you), and "yamas" (cheers, used when toasting) demonstrates respect for your host's culture and earns immediate goodwill. Greek maritime professionals appreciate the effort, even if your pronunciation is imperfect.</li>
                <li><strong>Dress appropriately for the occasion.</strong> Posidonia's dress code varies by context. The exhibition floor is business casual to business professional. Evening receptions typically call for business attire or smart casual. The Greek Shipping Awards is black tie. Greek shipping professionals tend to dress well, and appearing polished shows respect for the occasion and for the people you are meeting. In the June heat of Athens, lightweight fabrics and linen are perfectly acceptable.</li>
                <li><strong>Be prepared for late dinners.</strong> Greeks eat dinner late by Northern European and North American standards. Restaurant reservations at 9:00 PM or 9:30 PM are normal, and dinners can extend well past midnight. Some of the most important conversations at Posidonia happen between 10:00 PM and 1:00 AM at restaurant tables in Piraeus or the Athens Riviera. Pace yourself during the day so you have energy for the evening networking that is central to Greek business culture.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Athens Metropolitan Expo: Navigating the Venue</h2>
            <p>The Athens Metropolitan Expo is a modern exhibition complex located in Spata, near Athens International Airport. The venue spans multiple halls totaling over 50,000 square meters of exhibition space, and during Posidonia it is filled to capacity with roughly 2,000 exhibitors organized across several interconnected halls.</p>
            <p>The layout groups exhibitors by category and by national pavilion. Maritime equipment and services occupy the central halls, with major stands from engine manufacturers, coating companies, and equipment suppliers forming anchor points around which smaller exhibitors cluster. National pavilions line the perimeter and fill dedicated sections, with the Greek, Norwegian, South Korean, Chinese, Dutch, and Singaporean pavilions typically commanding the largest footprints. Classification societies position themselves at high-traffic intersections where they serve as natural meeting points for the show.</p>
            <p>The venue can feel overwhelming during peak hours, especially between 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM when foot traffic is heaviest. Experienced Posidonia attendees arrive early in the morning for scheduled meetings when the halls are quieter and the atmosphere is more conducive to substantive conversation. The first hour after opening and the last hour before closing are consistently the best times for meaningful booth visits. Midday is better spent attending conference sessions, grabbing lunch in the food court areas where casual encounters happen naturally, or retreating to a quiet corner to review notes and prepare for afternoon meetings.</p>
            <p>Water stations and refreshment areas are scattered throughout the venue, but Athens in June is hot. Temperatures regularly exceed 30 degrees Celsius, and the walk from parking areas or shuttle drop-off points to the exhibition halls exposes you to direct sun. Carry water, wear sunscreen, and dress in layers that work both in the air-conditioned halls and the outdoor walkways between buildings.</p>

            <h2>After-Hours Networking in Athens and Piraeus</h2>
            <p>Some of the most consequential networking at Posidonia happens after the exhibition halls close. Athens and its port city of Piraeus offer an extraordinary setting for the kind of relaxed, extended dining and socializing that defines Greek business culture.</p>

            <h3>Piraeus: The Heart of Greek Shipping</h3>
            <p>Piraeus is not just a port. It is the operational center of the Greek shipping industry, home to the offices of hundreds of shipping companies, ship management firms, maritime law practices, and marine insurance brokers. The waterfront area of Mikrolimano and the broader Piraeus marina district are lined with seafood restaurants and tavernas where shipping professionals have been conducting business over grilled fish and ouzo for generations. During Posidonia week, these restaurants are packed with maritime industry dinners every evening. Varoulko Seaside, one of Athens' Michelin-recognized seafood restaurants located on the Mikrolimano waterfront, is a popular choice for hosting important clients. The more casual tavernas along the marina are equally effective for relationship building and often provide a more authentic and relaxed atmosphere. Being seen dining in Piraeus during Posidonia week signals to the Greek shipping community that you understand where the real business happens.</p>

            <h3>The Athens Riviera</h3>
            <p>The coastal stretch from Faliro south through Glyfada, Vouliagmeni, and beyond is known as the Athens Riviera and has become a popular destination for Posidonia evening events and informal gatherings. Beach clubs, waterfront restaurants, and rooftop bars along this coast attract shipping professionals who prefer a more contemporary setting than the traditional Piraeus tavernas. The Astir Palace complex in Vouliagmeni and the Four Seasons Astir Palace Beach in particular have become magnets for high-profile maritime gatherings during Posidonia week.</p>

            <h3>Central Athens</h3>
            <p>The historic center of Athens, particularly the areas around Syntagma Square, Kolonaki, and the Plaka district beneath the Acropolis, offers rooftop bars and restaurants with iconic views that create memorable settings for business entertainment. The Grande Bretagne Hotel rooftop bar on Syntagma Square is a perennial Posidonia gathering point where chance encounters with industry leaders happen regularly. The Kolonaki neighborhood, with its upscale restaurants and bars, attracts the younger generation of Greek shipping professionals. For more casual networking, the streets of Psyrri and Gazi fill with energy every evening, and the relaxed atmosphere of these neighborhoods makes them ideal for continuing conversations that began on the exhibition floor.</p>

            <h2>Best Apps and Tools for Networking at Posidonia</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scannly.</strong> The maritime industry exchanges thousands of business cards during Posidonia week. Scannly lets you scan badges and business cards instantly, tag each contact with conversation notes, flag follow-up actions, and export everything to your CRM. In a show where you might meet contacts from 30 or 40 different countries, having a reliable digital system to capture and organize every connection is essential.</li>
                <li><strong>Posidonia Official App.</strong> The official event app provides the exhibitor directory, interactive floor plans, conference schedules, and event listings. Download it before you arrive and use it to build your daily agenda. The app also provides notifications about schedule changes and special announcements during the show.</li>
                <li><strong>LinkedIn.</strong> The maritime industry has embraced LinkedIn as its primary professional networking platform. Greek shipping executives, classification society leaders, and maritime technology founders are active on the platform. Send connection requests the same day you meet someone, include a reference to your conversation, and follow up with relevant content in the weeks after the show. Maritime-focused LinkedIn groups and company pages are excellent for staying engaged with the community between Posidonia editions.</li>
                <li><strong>TradeWinds and Lloyd's List.</strong> These maritime news platforms provide daily coverage of Posidonia, including deal announcements, event highlights, and industry interviews. Following their coverage during the show gives you conversation material and helps you stay informed about developments that might affect your networking priorities.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Translate.</strong> While English is the lingua franca of international shipping, you will encounter exhibitors and attendees who are more comfortable in Greek, Korean, Mandarin, Japanese, or other languages. Having a translation tool readily available helps bridge communication gaps and demonstrates respect for your counterparts' language preferences.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>On-Site Networking Strategies for Posidonia</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Work the national pavilions systematically.</strong> National pavilions concentrate companies from the same maritime cluster into a defined area, making it efficient to meet multiple relevant contacts in a short time. Visit the pavilions most relevant to your business first, and ask pavilion organizers to introduce you to specific companies. Pavilion staff are typically there to facilitate connections and are happy to make introductions.</li>
                <li><strong>Use classification society stands as meeting points.</strong> DNV, Lloyd's Register, and other class societies have relationships with virtually every shipowner, shipyard, and equipment manufacturer at the show. Their stands are natural gathering points where you can encounter a wide cross-section of the industry. If you have a relationship with a class society representative, ask them to introduce you to other contacts who stop by their stand.</li>
                <li><strong>Attend the conference sessions to identify thought leaders.</strong> Panelists and keynote speakers at Posidonia are among the most influential people in the maritime industry. Attending their sessions gives you insight into their perspectives and provides a natural reason to approach them afterward. Reference a specific point from their presentation when you introduce yourself. Speakers remember people who engaged thoughtfully with their ideas.</li>
                <li><strong>Bring business cards in abundance.</strong> Despite the rise of digital networking tools, the maritime industry remains deeply attached to the business card as a ritual of introduction. Bring at least twice as many cards as you think you will need. Consider having cards printed with both English and Greek text if you are specifically targeting the Greek market. The physical exchange of cards is often the moment that formalizes a new relationship in maritime culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Accept every coffee invitation.</strong> If someone invites you for coffee, whether at their exhibition stand, at a cafe in the venue, or at their office in Piraeus, accept. The coffee invitation is a cornerstone of Greek business culture and signals genuine interest in building a relationship. Declining or appearing hurried during coffee undermines the trust you are trying to establish.</li>
                <li><strong>Pace yourself across five days.</strong> Posidonia runs for five full days, which is longer than most international trade shows. The temptation is to sprint through the first two days and burn out by Wednesday. Experienced attendees structure their week with a deliberate rhythm: intensive scheduled meetings in the morning, exhibition floor exploration and conference sessions in the afternoon, and one carefully chosen evening event per night. Reserve energy for the final days of the show, when exhibitors are more available and the cumulative effect of multiple encounters throughout the week begins to deepen relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Take notes after every significant conversation.</strong> By the end of five days at Posidonia, you will have spoken with dozens of people from around the world. Without detailed notes, the faces, names, companies, and conversation details will blur together. After every meaningful exchange, step aside and spend 60 seconds recording who you met, what you discussed, what they need, and what you promised to do next. Use Scannly or a simple notes app to keep everything organized and searchable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Follow-Up Strategies for the Global Shipping Community</h2>
            <p>Posidonia's biennial schedule means the connections you make in June 2026 must sustain a two-year gap before the next edition. This makes follow-up not just important but essential. The maritime industry has a long memory, and how you handle the post-show period shapes your reputation for the next cycle.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Send personalized follow-ups within 48 hours.</strong> Reference your specific conversation, the stand where you met, the dinner you shared, or the conference session you attended together. Maritime professionals receive hundreds of generic post-show emails. The ones that demonstrate genuine recall and personal attention are the ones that get responses. If you met someone at a Piraeus restaurant or at the Greek Shipping Awards, mention the setting. Context triggers memory, and memory drives engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Segment your contacts by relationship depth and business priority.</strong> Separate your Posidonia contacts into tiers. First-tier contacts are people with whom you had substantive conversations and identified mutual business opportunities. They get a phone call or video meeting request within the first week. Second-tier contacts are people you connected with meaningfully but where the business case is still developing. They get a thoughtful email with relevant content and a suggestion to stay in touch. Third-tier contacts are general connections who expand your network. They get a LinkedIn request with a personal note referencing your meeting.</li>
                <li><strong>Lead with value before you ask for anything.</strong> Send a relevant market report, an interesting article from TradeWinds or Lloyd's List, a regulatory update that affects their fleet, or an introduction to someone else who could help their business. In the relationship-driven maritime industry, generosity and reciprocity are the foundations of trust. The person who consistently provides value between Posidonia editions is the one who gets meetings at the next one.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain contact through the two-year cycle.</strong> The maritime industry gathers at other events between Posidonia editions, including SMM in Hamburg, Nor-Shipping in Oslo, Singapore Maritime Week, and London International Shipping Week. Reaching out to your Posidonia contacts before and during these events keeps the relationship warm and demonstrates your ongoing commitment to the maritime community. A brief message before SMM saying "I noticed you are attending, would you have time for coffee?" is a simple but effective way to maintain momentum.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect the pace of maritime decision-making.</strong> Shipping is an industry where major decisions, newbuilding contracts, fleet technology upgrades, classification society changes, take months or years to finalize. A contact you make at Posidonia 2026 might not convert into a business opportunity until 2027 or 2028. Patient, consistent relationship building is the norm, not the exception. Do not pressure your contacts for quick decisions or interpret slow response times as disinterest. The maritime industry rewards persistence and patience in equal measure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Posidonia 2026 is more than a trade show. It is the biennial gathering of a global industry that moves 11 billion tons of goods across the world's oceans every year, and it takes place in Athens, the capital of the nation that owns more ships than any other country on earth. The 22,000 professionals and 2,000 exhibitors who converge on the Athens Metropolitan Expo from June 1 through 5 represent the full spectrum of the maritime world, from the family-owned Greek shipping dynasties to the South Korean mega-shipyards, from the century-old classification societies to the digital-native maritime technology startups reshaping an ancient industry. Navigating this world successfully requires understanding that maritime business is built on relationships that develop over years, not transactions completed in days. Prepare thoroughly before you arrive, engage authentically with the people you meet on the exhibition floor and at evening events across Athens and Piraeus, respect the rhythms of Greek hospitality and maritime tradition, and invest patiently in follow-up that sustains your connections through the two-year cycle until Posidonia 2028. The shipping industry is vast in scale but intimate in its networks. The relationships you build in Athens this June can carry your business forward for a generation.</p>
