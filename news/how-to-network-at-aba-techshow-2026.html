            <p>ABA TECHSHOW is the American Bar Association's annual legal technology conference, drawing approximately 3,000 attorneys, legal professionals, and legal tech vendors to Chicago each year. While it is smaller than mega-conferences, TECHSHOW's intimate size is actually its greatest networking strength. You can realistically meet and have meaningful conversations with a significant percentage of attendees over the two-day event. This guide will help you turn those conversations into lasting professional relationships.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Show Preparation: Making the Most of a Smaller Conference</h2>
            <p>The compact size of ABA TECHSHOW means your preparation can be more targeted and personal than at a massive trade show.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identify your networking goals.</strong> Are you a solo practitioner looking for practice management software? A legal tech vendor seeking to connect with firm decision-makers? An attorney exploring new tools for your practice area? With only 3,000 attendees, you can set very specific targets and realistically reach them.</li>
                <li><strong>Study the speaker and exhibitor lists.</strong> TECHSHOW publishes its speaker lineup and exhibitor directory on the conference website. Identify the people and companies most relevant to your goals. At a conference this size, you have a genuine chance of meeting every speaker and visiting every booth.</li>
                <li><strong>Join the TECHSHOW community online.</strong> Follow the TECHSHOW hashtag on social media and engage with pre-conference conversations. The legal tech community is active on X (Twitter) and LinkedIn, and many attendees are building connections weeks before the event.</li>
                <li><strong>Request meetings in advance.</strong> Reach out to speakers, exhibitors, and fellow attendees via LinkedIn or email. At a 3,000-person conference, people are much more responsive to meeting requests than they would be at a 40,000-person event.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare for CLE conversations.</strong> Many TECHSHOW attendees are attorneys earning Continuing Legal Education credits. Understanding the CLE sessions being offered gives you a natural conversation starter with fellow lawyers in the hallways between sessions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Networking Venues and Events at ABA TECHSHOW 2026</h2>

            <h3>The Expo Hall</h3>
            <p>TECHSHOW's exhibit hall features legal technology vendors ranging from large companies like Thomson Reuters and LexisNexis to small startups building niche tools for specific practice areas. The expo hall is manageable enough to visit every single booth over two days. Take advantage of this. Some of the most innovative solutions are at the smallest booths, and those exhibitors are eager to talk.</p>

            <h3>Educational Sessions and CLE Programs</h3>
            <p>The conference features dozens of sessions on topics like AI in law practice, cybersecurity for law firms, cloud-based practice management, and legal project management. Session rooms are typically small, which makes it easy to introduce yourself to the speaker afterward. Sit near the front, ask a question during Q&A, and follow up personally when the session ends.</p>

            <h3>Startup Alley</h3>
            <p>Startup Alley showcases emerging legal tech companies that are bringing new solutions to market. This is where you will find the most innovative and disruptive tools. The founders and developers staffing these booths are passionate about their products and tend to have in-depth, substantive conversations rather than rehearsed sales pitches.</p>

            <h3>Networking Receptions</h3>
            <p>TECHSHOW hosts official networking receptions where attendees can mingle over food and drinks in a relaxed setting. These events are deliberately designed to foster connections. At a 3,000-person conference, the receptions are intimate enough that you can work the room and meet a wide range of professionals.</p>

            <h3>Chicago Dinners and After-Hours Events</h3>
            <p>Chicago is a phenomenal dining city, and many TECHSHOW attendees organize informal dinners at restaurants in the Loop and River North neighborhoods. Keep an eye on social media for invitations. Legal tech vendors also host private dinners and cocktail hours at nearby venues. These smaller gatherings often yield the deepest connections.</p>

            <h3>The 60 Tips in 60 Minutes Session</h3>
            <p>This signature TECHSHOW session packs rapid-fire technology tips into a single hour and is one of the most popular events at the conference. The energy in the room is high, and the shared experience of absorbing so many practical tips creates natural conversation starters for the rest of the day.</p>

            <h2>Legal Industry-Specific Networking Tips</h2>
            <p>The legal profession has its own culture and norms around networking. Adapt your approach to fit the audience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Speak the language of practice management.</strong> Attorneys care about efficiency, billable hours, client intake, document management, and compliance. Frame your conversations around these practical concerns rather than abstract technology concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>Understand the solo and small firm perspective.</strong> A significant portion of TECHSHOW attendees are solo practitioners and small firm attorneys. These professionals make their own technology decisions and are actively looking for tools that make their practice more efficient. They appreciate practical, affordable solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect the ethical obligations.</strong> Lawyers have professional responsibility obligations around confidentiality, conflicts of interest, and client data security. If you are a vendor, demonstrating that you understand these concerns builds immediate trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Be a resource, not a salesperson.</strong> The legal community values generosity with knowledge. Share useful tips, recommend tools you have used (even if they are not yours), and offer genuine help. Lawyers remember people who provided value without expecting anything in return.</li>
                <li><strong>Leverage bar association connections.</strong> Many TECHSHOW attendees are active in state and local bar associations. If you share a bar association membership, mention it. These shared affiliations create instant rapport.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Best Apps and Tools for Networking at ABA TECHSHOW</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scannly.</strong> Capture contact information from badges and business cards with a quick scan. Even at a smaller conference, you can meet dozens of valuable contacts. Scannly keeps them organized with tags and notes so nothing gets lost.</li>
                <li><strong>ABA TECHSHOW App.</strong> The official conference app includes the schedule, exhibitor directory, floor maps, and attendee messaging. Set up your profile and use the app to plan your day and schedule meetings.</li>
                <li><strong>LinkedIn.</strong> The primary professional network for attorneys. Connect with people you meet at TECHSHOW the same day, with a personalized note mentioning your conversation.</li>
                <li><strong>Clio or MyCase.</strong> If you are an attorney, having your practice management tool on your phone lets you show colleagues how you manage your firm. Live demonstrations of how you use technology in your practice are compelling conversation pieces.</li>
                <li><strong>Notion or OneNote.</strong> Take notes after each meaningful conversation. Record details about what they are looking for, what tools they use, and what follow-up you promised. Your future self will thank you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>On-Site Networking Strategies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Treat every session as a networking opportunity.</strong> With only 3,000 attendees, every session room is a curated group of people who share your interest in a specific topic. Introduce yourself to the people sitting next to you before the session starts.</li>
                <li><strong>Visit the expo hall multiple times.</strong> The exhibit hall is small enough to walk through in an hour, but do not try to do it all at once. Visit on the first day for an overview, then return on the second day for deeper conversations with the vendors who caught your attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Volunteer or participate actively.</strong> TECHSHOW relies on volunteers, and the ABA community values active participation. Volunteering at the event puts you in a service role that naturally introduces you to organizers, speakers, and other engaged attendees.</li>
                <li><strong>Use meals strategically.</strong> Breakfast and lunch breaks at the conference are prime networking time. Instead of eating alone, sit down next to someone you do not know and introduce yourself. At a conference this size, these organic encounters can lead to meaningful relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Do not skip the last day.</strong> Many attendees leave early on the final day, which means smaller crowds and more one-on-one time with speakers and exhibitors. Some of the best networking happens when the conference is winding down and people are more relaxed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Follow-Up Strategies After ABA TECHSHOW</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Send follow-up emails within 48 hours.</strong> Reference a specific topic from your conversation. At a smaller conference, people are more likely to remember you, so capitalize on that personal connection.</li>
                <li><strong>Share session notes or resources.</strong> If you attended a great session, send your notes or a link to the presentation to contacts who missed it. This positions you as a generous connector in the community.</li>
                <li><strong>Write about your experience.</strong> Blog about your TECHSHOW takeaways or share a LinkedIn post summarizing what you learned. Tag the speakers and attendees you met. This extends your visibility and reinforces connections.</li>
                <li><strong>Join ABA committees and sections.</strong> The ABA has numerous technology-focused committees and sections that meet throughout the year. Joining one keeps you connected to the TECHSHOW community between annual events.</li>
                <li><strong>Plan for next year.</strong> If TECHSHOW was valuable, consider submitting a speaking proposal for next year. Speaking at TECHSHOW dramatically elevates your visibility in the legal tech community and creates networking opportunities that attendee-only status cannot match.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>ABA TECHSHOW 2026 may be smaller than many technology conferences, but its focused community of 3,000 legal professionals makes it an exceptionally high-value networking event. The intimate size means you can have substantive conversations with speakers, vendors, and fellow attorneys that simply are not possible at larger events. Come with clear goals, engage actively in sessions and social events, and follow up consistently. The legal tech community rewards those who show up with genuine interest and a willingness to share knowledge.</p>
