    <h2>Overview: The Two Biggest Construction Shows on Earth</h2>
    <p>The global construction equipment industry has two tentpole events that tower above everything else: CONEXPO-CON/AGG in Las Vegas and Bauma in Munich. Both are massive, both are triennial, and both claim to be the world's most important construction trade show. For exhibitors, buyers, and industry professionals who need to decide where to invest their time and budget, the choice between these two events is one of the most consequential decisions in the construction trade show calendar.</p>
    <p>Bauma 2025 ran from April 7 through 13 in Munich, Germany, while CONEXPO-CON/AGG 2026 is set for March 10 through 14 at the Las Vegas Convention Center and Festival Grounds. Because the two shows operate on staggered three-year cycles, many companies exhibit at both, but budget constraints and scheduling realities mean that many others must choose. Here is an honest, data-driven comparison to help you decide.</p>

    <h2>Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Category</th><th>CONEXPO-CON/AGG 2026</th><th>Bauma 2025</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Dates</td><td>March 10-14, 2026</td><td>April 7-13, 2025</td></tr>

    </table>

    <h2>Audience: Who Attends Each Show</h2>
    <p>The audience profiles of these two shows reflect their geographic positioning and market focus. CONEXPO-CON/AGG draws predominantly from the Americas, with approximately 30% of its attendees coming from outside the United States. The show has a strong representation of general contractors, heavy highway builders, concrete and aggregates producers, equipment dealers, and rental companies. The attendee profile skews toward mid-size to large operations, with a significant presence of owner-operators and fleet managers who make direct purchasing decisions.</p>
    <p>Bauma, by contrast, is a truly global event. With nearly 500,000 attendees from more than 200 countries, it draws the broadest international audience of any construction trade show. European manufacturers dominate the exhibitor list, but the buyer audience comes from every continent, with particularly strong delegations from the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, and China. Bauma also spans a wider range of industries than CONEXPO, including mining machinery, building materials production, and construction vehicles, alongside the traditional earthmoving and lifting equipment categories.</p>
    <p>For companies whose primary market is the Americas, CONEXPO delivers a more concentrated audience of relevant buyers. For companies that sell globally or are looking to expand into international markets, Bauma offers unmatched geographic diversity.</p>

    <h2>Location and Logistics</h2>
    <p>CONEXPO benefits from the Las Vegas infrastructure: a massive convention center, abundant hotel rooms at every price point, direct flights from nearly every major U.S. city, and a city built to handle large events. The Las Vegas Convention Center has undergone significant expansion, including the new West Hall, and the Tesla Loop underground transportation system helps attendees move between halls. The downside is that Las Vegas hotel rates spike during CONEXPO, and restaurants and services can feel strained under the weight of 130,000 additional visitors.</p>
    <p>Bauma occupies the Munich Trade Fair Centre (Messe Munchen), one of the largest exhibition complexes in the world, with more than 614,000 square meters of indoor and outdoor exhibit space. Munich is well-connected by air from most European capitals and many international hubs, and the German rail system provides efficient ground transportation. However, hotel availability during Bauma is a serious challenge. Munich is a smaller city than Las Vegas, and its hotel capacity is stretched to the breaking point during the show. Many attendees stay 30 to 60 minutes outside the city and commute by train. Booking accommodations six months or more in advance is strongly recommended.</p>
    <p>For American companies, CONEXPO offers obvious logistical advantages: no jet lag, no international shipping complications, and familiar business culture. For European and international companies, Bauma is more accessible and the central European location simplifies logistics for global exhibitors who ship equipment from multiple continents.</p>

    <h2>Cost Comparison</h2>
    <p>The total cost of participating in either show varies dramatically depending on booth size, location, and build-out, but general patterns emerge. CONEXPO booth space typically ranges from $30 to $50 per square foot for standard locations, with premium positions commanding higher rates. Bauma booth space is generally priced at EUR 150 to EUR 250 per square meter for indoor space, with outdoor space available at lower rates.</p>
    <p>Travel and accommodation costs differ significantly by origin. For a U.S.-based team, attending CONEXPO in Las Vegas is substantially cheaper than traveling to Munich: domestic flights, no passport requirements, and hotel rates that, while elevated during the show, are still manageable. For a European team, Bauma is the more cost-effective option, with shorter travel distances and more affordable regional accommodation alternatives.</p>
    <p>One often-overlooked cost factor is duration. Bauma runs seven full days compared to CONEXPO's five. The additional two days translate to higher hotel, meal, staffing, and opportunity costs. For smaller companies with limited teams, the extended duration of Bauma can strain both budgets and personnel.</p>

    <h2>The Verdict: Which Show Is Right for You?</h2>
    <p>The answer depends on your market, your audience, and your strategic priorities.</p>
    <p><strong>Choose CONEXPO-CON/AGG 2026 if:</strong> Your primary market is North or South America. You want to reach U.S. contractors, dealers, and rental companies. You prefer the logistical simplicity of a domestic U.S. event. You have a limited budget and need to minimize travel costs. You want a concentrated five-day event that allows you to see the full show without a full week commitment.</p>
    <p><strong>Choose Bauma if:</strong> You sell globally and need access to buyers from 200-plus countries. You want the largest possible audience and do not mind a seven-day commitment. Your primary markets include Europe, the Middle East, Africa, or Asia. You are a European or international company for whom Munich is more accessible than Las Vegas. You want to see the broadest possible range of construction machinery and technology, including categories that CONEXPO covers less deeply.</p>
    <p><strong>The ideal scenario:</strong> If your budget permits, attend both shows on their respective three-year cycles. Because the events are staggered, you can alternate between them, maintaining visibility in both the American and international markets. Many of the industry's most successful manufacturers and suppliers do exactly this, treating CONEXPO and Bauma as complementary pillars of a global trade show strategy rather than an either-or decision.</p>
    <p>Regardless of which show you choose, the professionals who get the most value are those who prepare extensively, set specific objectives, and follow up with discipline.
