<h1>How to Network at PACK EXPO International 2026: Mastering McCormick Place's Packaging Mega-Show</h1>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586528116311-ad8dd3c8310d?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop" alt="Packaging and manufacturing production line representing PACK EXPO International" loading="lazy">

<p>PACK EXPO International 2026 descends on McCormick Place in Chicago from October 18 to 21, commanding every square foot of the largest convention center in North America. With more than 2,500 exhibitors and an expected 44,000-plus attendees, this is the world's largest packaging and processing trade show, and it is organized by PMMI, the Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies. There is no event on the planet where the packaging industry gathers in greater concentration.</p>

<p>The sheer scale of PACK EXPO International is both its greatest asset and its most dangerous trap. McCormick Place spans multiple halls connected by skywalks and corridors that can swallow hours of walking time if you approach the show without a strategy. The attendees who extract the most value from this week are not the ones who see the most booths. They are the ones who engineer the right conversations with the right people at the right moments. This guide will show you how to do exactly that.</p>

<h2>Pre-Show Outreach: The Three to Four Weeks That Define Your Week</h2>

<p>The most productive networking at PACK EXPO International does not happen on the show floor. It happens in the weeks before the show, when you lay the groundwork that transforms a chaotic mega-event into a series of purposeful meetings.</p>

<h3>MapYourShow: Your Strategic Command Center</h3>
<p>PACK EXPO uses the MapYourShow platform, and it is the single most important tool in your pre-show arsenal. The interactive floor plan allows you to search the entire exhibitor list and filter by technology category, whether you are sourcing filling equipment, labeling systems, flexible packaging materials, robotic palletizers, or inspection and detection technology. Spend an evening working through the categories relevant to your business and flag every exhibitor worth a conversation.</p>

<p>Once you have your shortlist, use MapYourShow to schedule demonstrations and meetings directly with exhibitors. The companies that bring live equipment to PACK EXPO invest heavily in those demonstrations, and they staff their booths with senior engineers and sales leaders who can answer technical questions on the spot. A pre-scheduled demo ensures you get face time with those decision-makers rather than arriving at a crowded booth and hoping for the best.</p>

<h3>LinkedIn: The Pre-Show Handshake</h3>
<p>After identifying your target exhibitors, find their key personnel on LinkedIn. Send connection requests with a brief, specific message explaining that you will be at PACK EXPO International and would like to connect at their booth. Mention a particular product or technology that interests you. This small effort separates you from the thousands of anonymous badge-holders who will walk past their booth during the show. When you arrive, they will already know your name.</p>

<p>Do not limit your outreach to exhibitors. Search LinkedIn for industry peers who are posting about their plans to attend PACK EXPO. Fellow attendees from complementary companies often become the most valuable long-term relationships. A packaging engineer from a food company and a packaging engineer from a pharmaceutical company face many of the same challenges with different regulatory constraints, and the exchange of ideas between them can be remarkably productive.</p>

<h3>PMMI ProSource: Supplier Matching Done Right</h3>
<p>PMMI operates ProSource, a supplier matching service that connects buyers with packaging and processing equipment manufacturers. If you are actively sourcing equipment or technology, register with ProSource before the show. The platform matches your specific requirements with qualified suppliers, effectively curating a shortlist of exhibitors you should prioritize during PACK EXPO. This is not a generic recommendation engine. It is built on PMMI's deep knowledge of its member companies and their capabilities.</p>

<h2>Show Floor Tactics: Working McCormick Place Like a Professional</h2>

<p>McCormick Place is enormous. The complex encompasses the North, South, and West Buildings plus the Lakeside Center, connected by a network of corridors and the Grand Concourse. Trying to cover everything in a single day is a recipe for exhaustion and shallow conversations. The professionals who get the most from PACK EXPO work systematically.</p>

<h3>One Hall Per Day</h3>
<p>The best strategy is deceptively simple: dedicate one day to one hall. This approach gives you time to visit your priority exhibitors, watch full equipment demonstrations, attend nearby Innovation Stage sessions, and still have margin for the unplanned conversations that often prove most valuable. When you try to sprint between halls, you spend your energy on walking rather than talking, and every conversation gets cut short because you are already thinking about where you need to be next.</p>

<p>On your first morning, consult the floor plan and assign each day a geographic focus. Block your mornings for pre-scheduled meetings and demonstrations, leave your afternoons open for exploration within that same hall, and protect your evening hours for relationship-building over dinner.</p>

<h3>Start with the Innovation Stage</h3>
<p>The Innovation Stage hosts free 30-minute sessions throughout the show, covering the topics that are reshaping the packaging industry: robotics and automation, cybersecurity for manufacturing operations, sustainability and circular packaging, and digital transformation of the packaging line. These sessions serve a dual purpose. First, they deliver genuinely useful education from practitioners and technology leaders. Second, they function as networking filters. The people sitting around you at a session on robotic case packing are precisely the people interested in robotic case packing. Arrive a few minutes early, sit near the middle of a row rather than on the aisle, and introduce yourself to the people on either side before the session begins.</p>

<p>After the session ends, linger near the stage for five minutes. The speakers often remain to answer questions, and the attendees who were most engaged will cluster nearby. This is where the best conversations of the day frequently happen, in the informal five-minute window after a presentation when everyone's thinking has been sharpened by the same ideas.</p>

<h3>The Healthcare Packaging Pavilion: Do Not Walk Past the Highest Margins in the Building</h3>
<p>Tucked into 70,000 square feet of the West Building, the Healthcare Packaging Pavilion is a show within the show. This dedicated section focuses on packaging for pharmaceuticals, biologics, nutraceuticals, and medical devices. The regulatory requirements in healthcare packaging are extraordinarily demanding, which means the exhibitors here offer specialized solutions and the attendees represent companies with substantial budgets.</p>

<p>If your business touches healthcare, biotech, or medical devices in any capacity, the Healthcare Packaging Pavilion deserves a full morning of your time. The density of specialized expertise in this space is remarkable. You will find serialization and track-and-trace technology providers alongside sterile fill-finish equipment manufacturers, cold chain packaging specialists, and child-resistant closure innovators. The conversations here tend to be deeper and more technically specific than on the general show floor, and the business relationships forged in this pavilion often carry the highest long-term value.</p>

<h3>Live Equipment Demonstrations: Where Conversations Come Alive</h3>
<p>PACK EXPO International is famous for its live equipment demonstrations. Unlike trade shows where exhibitors display static products behind velvet ropes, PACK EXPO exhibitors run their machines on the show floor. Filling lines fill. Cartoners carton. Robotic pick-and-place systems pick and place. The sensory experience of watching a high-speed packaging line operate at full capacity is something no video or brochure can replicate.</p>

<p>These demonstrations create natural networking opportunities. When you stand next to someone watching a shrink wrapper process 120 packages per minute, you are standing next to someone who cares about shrink wrapping. Ask what they thought of the speed. Ask if they are running similar equipment in their facility. Ask what problem brought them to this particular booth. Live demos dissolve the awkwardness of cold introductions because the shared experience provides an instant conversation starter.</p>

<h3>Connect with Distributors and OEMs</h3>
<p>PACK EXPO draws not only end users but also a significant population of distributors, original equipment manufacturers, and systems integrators. These intermediaries often have broad visibility across multiple industries and can introduce you to solutions you did not know existed. When you meet a distributor representative, ask which new products they are most excited about and which exhibitors are generating the most buzz. Distributors are networking multipliers: a single good relationship with a distributor can open doors to a dozen equipment manufacturers.</p>

<h2>Education and Learning as Networking</h2>

<p>The formal education program at PACK EXPO International is free, and it is far more than filler content between booth visits. The sessions are structured to address real operational challenges, and they attract attendees who are actively working to solve those challenges. This makes the education program one of the most efficient networking mechanisms at the show.</p>

<h3>Innovation Stage Sessions as Meeting Points</h3>
<p>Coordinate with your pre-show contacts to meet at specific Innovation Stage sessions. Instead of the generic "let's grab coffee on Tuesday," suggest "let's attend the 2:00 PM session on sustainable packaging materials and debrief afterward." This approach accomplishes three things: it ensures you both get value from the session content, it gives you a concrete topic to discuss over the debrief, and it signals that you are serious about the subject matter rather than just collecting business cards.</p>

<h3>PACK gives Back: Charity That Builds Relationships</h3>
<p>PACK gives Back is PACK EXPO's charitable initiative, and participating in these events during the show is one of the most underutilized networking strategies available. Charitable activities create a fundamentally different dynamic than business interactions. When you work alongside someone on a service project, you see their character rather than their sales pitch. The relationships formed through shared purpose tend to be more durable and more genuine than those formed through transactional exchanges. Watch the PACK EXPO schedule for PACK gives Back events and sign up early.</p>

<h3>Workforce Development and Sustainability Sessions</h3>
<p>Two session tracks deserve special attention for their networking potential. Workforce development sessions attract operations leaders and HR professionals who are grappling with labor shortages, training challenges, and automation transitions. If you sell solutions that address workforce challenges, these sessions put you in a room with your ideal customers.</p>

<p>Sustainability sessions, meanwhile, connect a rapidly growing community of eco-minded exhibitors and buyers who are working toward circular packaging, reduced material usage, and carbon footprint reduction. Sustainability is no longer a niche concern in packaging. It is a boardroom priority, and the professionals who attend these sessions are increasingly the ones with budget authority to fund sustainable packaging initiatives.</p>

<h2>After-Hours Chicago Networking: From McCormick Place to the Magnificent Mile</h2>

<p>The show floor closes, but the networking does not. Chicago is one of the great convention cities in America, and the infrastructure around McCormick Place is built for exactly this kind of after-hours relationship building.</p>

<h3>McCormick Place Area Dining</h3>
<p>The restaurants and bars within walking distance of McCormick Place fill up fast during PACK EXPO week. Make dinner reservations at least two weeks in advance for any group larger than four. The South Loop neighborhood adjacent to McCormick Place has evolved significantly in recent years, with a growing selection of restaurants that range from casual to upscale. For larger group dinners, the Magnificent Mile and River North neighborhoods offer dozens of options, though you will need a rideshare or taxi for the 15-to-20-minute trip north.</p>

<h3>The Deep Dish Protocol</h3>
<p>There is an unwritten rule of Chicago trade shows: you must eat deep dish pizza at least once. Lou Malnati's and Giordano's are the two names that dominate the conversation, and both have multiple locations throughout the city. Deep dish pizza takes 45 minutes to bake, which means ordering a pizza is actually a commitment to sit down and talk for an hour. This forced patience makes deep dish dinners surprisingly effective networking sessions. Nobody rushes through a Lou Malnati's Buttercrust. Order for the table, share a meal, and let the conversation develop at its own pace.</p>

<h3>PMMI Organized Events and Receptions</h3>
<p>PMMI hosts several organized receptions and networking events throughout PACK EXPO week. These events are often the easiest way to meet senior industry leaders in a relaxed setting. The reception format lowers barriers to introduction: everyone is there to meet people, the atmosphere is social rather than transactional, and the shared context of the show gives every conversation a natural starting point. Check the PMMI event calendar as part of your pre-show planning and register early for any events that align with your networking objectives.</p>

<h3>Industry Dinners Along the Magnificent Mile</h3>
<p>Many exhibitors, industry associations, and user groups organize private dinners during PACK EXPO week, and the Magnificent Mile is the most popular destination. If you receive an invitation to one of these dinners, accept it. If you do not receive one, consider organizing your own. Invite six to eight people you have met during the show, choose a restaurant with a private dining room, and set a loose agenda around a topic of shared interest. The cost of dinner is negligible compared to the value of deepening relationships with people who are genuinely relevant to your business.</p>

<h2>Follow-Up Strategy: The 48-Hour Window</h2>

<p>The networking you do at PACK EXPO International is an investment. The follow-up you do afterward is what determines whether that investment pays a return. The 48-hour window after the show ends is critical. Wait longer, and your new contacts will have buried your business card under a stack of others.</p>

<h3>Connect Within 48 Hours</h3>
<p>Send LinkedIn connection requests and personalized follow-up emails within 48 hours of the show closing. Do not send the same generic message to everyone. Each follow-up should reference something specific from your conversation: a particular equipment demonstration you watched together, a challenge they described, a mutual contact you discovered. Specificity proves that you were paying attention, and it separates your message from the dozens of templated follow-ups that every attendee receives after a major show.</p>

<h3>Reference Specific Equipment Demonstrations</h3>
<p>If you watched a live demo at an exhibitor's booth and discussed the technology with their team, reference that demonstration in your follow-up. Mention the specific machine model, the throughput you observed, or the particular feature that addressed your operational need. This level of detail signals genuine buying interest and moves you to the front of the exhibitor's follow-up queue.</p>

<h3>Request Quotes and Spec Sheets</h3>
<p>Do not leave the commercial momentum on the table. If a piece of equipment or a technology solution impressed you, request a formal quote and detailed specification sheets in your follow-up email. Exhibitors invest enormous resources in PACK EXPO, and the ones who close business after the show are the ones who respond fastest to quote requests. By asking for a quote, you are telling the exhibitor that your interest is commercial, not casual.</p>

<h3>Schedule Plant Visits</h3>
<p>The ultimate follow-up from a packaging trade show is a plant visit. If an exhibitor demonstrated equipment that could solve a real problem in your facility, invite them to visit your plant or ask to visit their demonstration facility. A plant visit moves the relationship from trade show acquaintance to genuine business partner, and it gives both parties the context they need to evaluate whether a solution is truly the right fit.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes: What Derails Networking at PACK EXPO</h2>

<h3>Trying to See Everything in One Day</h3>
<p>This is the most common mistake at PACK EXPO International, and it is the most costly. McCormick Place is massive, the exhibitor list runs past 2,500 companies, and the temptation to cover as much ground as possible is overwhelming. Resist it. You cannot have a meaningful conversation while speed-walking to your next destination. Depth beats breadth at every trade show, but especially at one this size. Pick your priorities, commit to your plan, and accept that you will not see everything. Nobody does.</p>

<h3>Skipping the Healthcare Packaging Pavilion</h3>
<p>Attendees who do not work directly in healthcare often skip the Healthcare Packaging Pavilion entirely, assuming it is irrelevant to their business. This is a mistake. The technologies showcased in the pavilion, including serialization, track-and-trace, tamper-evidence, and controlled-environment packaging, have applications that extend well beyond pharma. More importantly, the Healthcare Packaging Pavilion represents some of the highest-margin opportunities at the show. The companies exhibiting there serve industries where packaging failures have regulatory and safety consequences, which means they are willing to invest in premium solutions.</p>

<h3>Forgetting Comfortable Shoes</h3>
<p>This sounds trivial. It is not. McCormick Place is the largest convention center in North America. The distance from one end to the other is measured not in steps but in miles. Attendees who show up in dress shoes or new footwear spend their second and third days limping between booths and cutting conversations short because their feet are screaming. Wear broken-in, comfortable shoes with good arch support. Your networking effectiveness is directly proportional to your physical comfort, and by Day Three, the difference between good shoes and bad shoes is the difference between productive and miserable.</p>

<h3>Missing the Innovation Stage</h3>
<p>The Innovation Stage sessions are free. They are delivered by industry experts. They cover the most important trends in packaging technology. And a surprising number of attendees walk right past them because they feel like they should be spending every minute on the show floor. This is backwards thinking. The Innovation Stage sessions sharpen your understanding of the technologies you are evaluating, introduce you to fellow attendees who share your interests, and give you informed questions to ask when you visit exhibitor booths. Skipping them does not save you time. It costs you context.</p>

<h2>Making PACK EXPO International Count</h2>

<p>PACK EXPO International 2026 is a four-day immersion in the global packaging and processing industry. The companies that fill McCormick Place represent the full spectrum of packaging technology, from entry-level semi-automatic equipment to fully integrated robotic lines that run lights-out. The attendees walking those halls are the engineers, operations leaders, procurement professionals, and executives who decide how the world's products get packaged, preserved, and delivered.</p>

<p>The opportunity is extraordinary, but only if you approach it with intention. Plan your outreach before you arrive. Work the show floor methodically. Use education sessions as networking accelerators. Invest your evenings in relationship-building over Chicago's best food. And follow up within 48 hours with the kind of specificity that proves you were paying attention. PACK EXPO International rewards preparation. Show up with a plan, and you will leave with partnerships that outlast the show by years.</p>
