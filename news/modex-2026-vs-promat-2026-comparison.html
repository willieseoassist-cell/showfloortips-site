            <p>If you work in supply chain, logistics, or material handling, you have almost certainly encountered the names MODEX and ProMat. Both are organized by MHI, the largest material handling and supply chain trade association in the United States, and both serve the same broad industry. Yet they are distinct events with different personalities, different venues, and different strengths. MODEX 2026 takes place April 13 through 16 in Atlanta, while ProMat most recently ran in 2025 in Chicago and will return in 2027. The two shows alternate on an annual cycle, meaning you get one or the other each year. Understanding what each show offers and how they differ is essential for deciding where to invest your time and budget. This comparison breaks down everything you need to know.</p>

            <h2>The MHI Alternating Cycle: How It Works</h2>
            <p>MODEX and ProMat are siblings, not competitors. MHI deliberately alternates them on a two-year cycle, with MODEX in even-numbered years and ProMat in odd-numbered years. This structure serves two purposes. First, it gives the supply chain industry a major trade show every single year without oversaturating the calendar. Second, it allows MHI to offer two distinct geographic options: Atlanta for MODEX and Chicago for ProMat. Many exhibitors and attendees participate in both shows, treating them as a continuous biennial cycle rather than as separate events. The exhibitor base overlaps significantly, with the largest material handling companies maintaining a presence at both shows.</p>
            <p>For budget planning purposes, this means you are effectively choosing one show per year. In 2026, that is MODEX in Atlanta. If you prefer Chicago and can wait, ProMat 2027 is the alternative. The question is whether the differences between the two shows are significant enough to drive your decision, or whether the timing and geography are what matter most.</p>

            <h2>Venue and Location Differences</h2>
            <p>The venue difference is one of the most tangible distinctions between MODEX and ProMat, and it affects the attendee experience more than you might expect.</p>
            <p><strong>MODEX at Georgia World Congress Center:</strong> The GWCC is located in the heart of downtown Atlanta, adjacent to Centennial Olympic Park. The exhibition fills Halls A, B, and C with approximately 600,000 square feet of show floor. The venue is walkable to dozens of hotels, restaurants, and entertainment options in downtown Atlanta. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic, is a short MARTA train ride away. Atlanta's relatively lower hotel costs compared to Chicago make MODEX slightly more budget-friendly for attendees, with downtown hotels averaging $180 to $280 per night during the show.</p>
            <p><strong>ProMat at McCormick Place:</strong> McCormick Place is the largest convention center in North America, located on Chicago's lakefront. The sheer size of the facility gives ProMat slightly more exhibition space, exceeding 700,000 square feet in recent editions. McCormick Place is a purpose-built convention venue with excellent logistics for large-scale exhibitions. However, it is somewhat isolated from downtown Chicago, requiring a taxi, rideshare, or bus to reach the hotels and restaurants in the Loop and South Loop. Chicago hotel rates near the venue tend to be higher, averaging $220 to $350 per night during ProMat week.</p>
            <p>The practical impact is that MODEX in Atlanta offers a more walkable, integrated experience where the convention center, hotels, and dining are all within easy reach. ProMat in Chicago offers a larger venue and the broader appeal of Chicago as a destination, but requires more commuting between the show floor and your hotel.</p>

            <h2>Audience and Regional Differences</h2>
            <p>While both shows are national events that draw from across the United States and increasingly from international markets, there are subtle audience differences driven by geography.</p>
            <p>MODEX in Atlanta draws a stronger contingent from the Southeast, the Sun Belt, and the rapidly growing logistics corridors in Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, and the Carolinas. Atlanta's position as a major logistics hub, home to some of the country's busiest distribution corridors and a massive e-commerce fulfillment infrastructure, means the local and regional attendees at MODEX tend to include a high proportion of distribution center operators, e-commerce logistics professionals, and Sun Belt manufacturers.</p>
            <p>ProMat in Chicago draws more heavily from the Midwest, the Northeast, and the traditional manufacturing heartland. Chicago's history as a transportation and manufacturing center means the ProMat audience often includes more attendees from heavy manufacturing, automotive supply chains, and cold chain logistics. The Midwest's concentration of food and beverage manufacturers, automotive suppliers, and industrial distributors gives ProMat a slightly different operational flavor.</p>
            <p>These regional differences are subtle, not dramatic. Both shows attract a national audience, and the exhibitor base is largely the same. But if your customer base or target market is concentrated in a particular region, the geographic draw of each show is worth considering.</p>

            <h2>Content and Programming Differences</h2>
            <p>Both MODEX and ProMat offer more than 200 free educational seminars organized across similar track structures covering automation, robotics, distribution, warehousing, manufacturing, and supply chain technology. The seminar programming is refreshed for each show, but the overall format and quality are consistent because MHI manages the educational content for both events.</p>
            <p>Where MODEX 2026 distinguishes itself is in its dedicated focus areas within the exhibition. Hall A features a StartUp Pavilion that gives emerging supply chain technology companies a visible, concentrated presence on the show floor. The Sustainability Zone in Hall A reflects the growing importance of environmental responsibility in supply chain operations. The Last Mile area addresses the specific challenges of final-delivery logistics that have become critical in the e-commerce era. These dedicated zones give MODEX a reputation for being slightly more forward-looking and innovation-oriented than ProMat.</p>
            <p>ProMat, by contrast, benefits from the legacy and prestige of being the longer-established show. ProMat has been running since the 1980s, and many industry veterans consider it the original and definitive supply chain trade show. This institutional history gives ProMat a slightly more established, traditional feel, which appeals to attendees and exhibitors who value continuity and the show's long track record.</p>

            <h2>Cost Comparison for Exhibitors</h2>
            <p>For exhibitors making a significant financial commitment, the cost differences between MODEX and ProMat are worth examining carefully.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Booth space:</strong> Pricing for both shows is managed by MHI and is broadly comparable on a per-square-foot basis. Rates vary by hall location, booth size, and corner or island positioning. Exhibitors should request quotes for both shows to compare specific costs for their desired configuration.</li>
                <li><strong>Freight and logistics:</strong> Shipping exhibit materials to Atlanta versus Chicago involves different freight costs depending on where your equipment originates. The GWCC and McCormick Place both have efficient loading dock operations, but the specific costs of drayage, labor, and material handling can vary between the two venues and their respective union labor environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Travel and lodging:</strong> Atlanta generally offers lower hotel rates and lower overall travel costs for exhibitor teams compared to Chicago. For a company sending a team of 10 or more people for a full week including setup and teardown, the accommodation savings in Atlanta can be meaningful.</li>
                <li><strong>Staff meals and entertainment:</strong> Atlanta and Chicago both offer excellent dining, but Atlanta tends to be more affordable for group dinners and client entertainment. This is a secondary consideration, but for companies hosting evening events or client dinners during the show, the cost differential adds up.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>ROI Considerations for Attendees</h2>
            <p>For attendees, both shows are free to register, which eliminates the ticket cost variable. The ROI calculation comes down to travel costs, time away from the office, and the value of the connections and knowledge you bring back.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If you can only attend one show per year,</strong> attend whichever show falls in the current calendar year. In 2026, that is MODEX. The supply chain industry moves fast, and waiting an extra year for ProMat 2027 means missing a year of face-to-face engagement with the vendor community and your industry peers.</li>
                <li><strong>If you are evaluating emerging technology,</strong> MODEX's StartUp Pavilion and dedicated innovation zones give it a slight edge for attendees focused on scouting new solutions. The concentration of startups and sustainability-focused exhibitors in Hall A creates a walkable innovation corridor that does not have a direct equivalent at ProMat.</li>
                <li><strong>If you are a first-time attendee,</strong> either show will deliver excellent value. The exhibition floor, the educational seminars, and the networking opportunities are broadly comparable. Choose based on which city is more convenient and which dates work better for your schedule.</li>
                <li><strong>If you attend both shows on the alternating cycle,</strong> you get the best of both worlds. Many supply chain professionals treat MODEX and ProMat as a single, biennial program, attending MODEX in even years and ProMat in odd years. This approach ensures you never go more than 12 months without a major MHI show and allows you to maintain relationships with the exhibitors and peers you see at each event.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who Should Prioritize MODEX 2026?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Southeast and Sun Belt-based companies</strong> for whom Atlanta is a convenient, cost-effective destination.</li>
                <li><strong>Professionals focused on automation and robotics</strong> who want to see the latest AMRs, AS/RS systems, and automated picking solutions demonstrated live in Halls B and C.</li>
                <li><strong>Innovation scouts and startup evaluators</strong> who want dedicated time in the StartUp Pavilion and Sustainability Zone.</li>
                <li><strong>Anyone who cannot wait until 2027.</strong> If you need to connect with the supply chain vendor community this year, MODEX 2026 is the show.</li>
                <li><strong>Young professionals and career developers</strong> who want to take advantage of the $10 Young Professionals Event and the broader networking opportunities at Industry Night.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who Should Wait for ProMat 2027?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Midwest and Northeast-based companies</strong> for whom Chicago is more accessible and cost-effective than Atlanta.</li>
                <li><strong>Companies with Chicago-area operations</strong> who can reduce travel costs by attending a local show.</li>
                <li><strong>Professionals who prioritize the ProMat brand</strong> and its longer institutional history in the supply chain industry.</li>
                <li><strong>Exhibitors who are already committed to MODEX 2026</strong> and want to space out their trade show investments across two calendar years.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Verdict: Which Show Is Right for You?</h2>
            <p>The honest answer is that MODEX and ProMat are more similar than they are different. Both are organized by MHI. Both draw 1,000-plus exhibitors and tens of thousands of attendees. Both offer free registration, 200-plus educational seminars, and comprehensive coverage of the supply chain technology landscape. The core experience of walking the show floor, attending sessions, and networking with industry peers is excellent at both events.</p>
            <p>The meaningful differences come down to timing, geography, and emphasis. MODEX 2026 is happening now, in April, in Atlanta, with a dedicated StartUp Pavilion, a Sustainability Zone, and Industry Night with Jim Gaffigan. If you are ready to engage with the supply chain community this year, MODEX is your show. If Chicago is a better fit for your organization and you can wait until 2027, ProMat will deliver a comparable experience at McCormick Place.</p>
            <p>For the most comprehensive industry coverage, attend both shows on the alternating cycle. MODEX in even years and ProMat in odd years ensures you are present at the supply chain industry's biggest gathering every single year, maintaining the relationships and market awareness that drive success in this fast-moving industry.</p>
