            <p>The legal technology space has two marquee annual conferences that dominate the calendar: ABA TECHSHOW in Chicago and Legalweek in New York City.

This guide compares the two events side by side to help you decide which one deserves your time and budget in 2026.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the Audience Differences</h2>
            <p>The audience difference between ABA TECHSHOW and Legalweek is the single most important factor in choosing between them.</p>
            <p><strong>ABA TECHSHOW</strong> draws a practitioner-focused crowd. Many attendees are solo practitioners and small firm attorneys who are personally responsible for choosing and implementing technology in their practices. You will also find legal technologists, law school professors, legal aid organizations, and a strong contingent of ABA committee members. The atmosphere is collegial and accessible. Speakers are approachable, and the community is welcoming to newcomers. If you are an attorney who wants hands-on, practical guidance on incorporating technology into your daily work, this is your crowd.</p>
            <p><strong>Legalweek</strong> attracts enterprise legal professionals. The audience skews toward large law firms (AmLaw 100 and 200), corporate legal departments, legal operations managers, e-discovery professionals, and the vendors who serve them. Legalweek is actually a collection of sub-conferences including LegalTech (the largest), the Business of Law Forum, and specialized tracks on compliance and legal operations. The conversations here revolve around enterprise-scale challenges: managing millions of documents in litigation, deploying AI across a 1,000-attorney firm, and optimizing legal department budgets of hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

            <h2>Scope and Content Differences</h2>
            <p>ABA TECHSHOW delivers practical, implementable education. Sessions cover topics like setting up a paperless law office, choosing the right practice management software, using AI tools for legal research, cybersecurity fundamentals for small firms, and digital marketing for attorneys. The famous "60 Tips in 60 Minutes" session epitomizes the TECHSHOW philosophy: rapid-fire, actionable advice that attendees can put to work immediately. Startup Alley showcases emerging legal tech companies, giving attendees early access to innovative tools.</p>
            <p>Legalweek operates at a different scale and sophistication level. The LegalTech sub-conference is historically the premier event for e-discovery and information governance professionals. Sessions address topics like predictive coding, TAR (technology-assisted review), cross-border data privacy compliance, and enterprise contract management. The Business of Law Forum focuses on law firm strategy, pricing innovation, and legal operations optimization. The content assumes a baseline of technological sophistication and addresses enterprise-level implementation challenges.</p>

            <h2>Cost Considerations</h2>
            <p>The cost difference between these two events is substantial and reflects their different target audiences.</p>
            <p>ABA TECHSHOW registration typically ranges from $600 to $900, with significant discounts for ABA members and early registration. Chicago hotel rates are reasonable compared to New York, and the conference venue is conveniently located. The total cost for a solo practitioner to attend TECHSHOW, including registration, hotel, and travel, can be kept under $2,000 depending on your location.</p>
            <p>Legalweek is a bigger investment. Full conference passes range from $1,500 to over $3,000 depending on which sub-conferences you register for and when you book. New York City hotel rates near the Midtown Manhattan venue can easily exceed $350 per night. A full Legalweek experience including registration, hotel, meals, and travel can cost $4,000 to $6,000 or more. For enterprise attendees whose firms cover the expense, this is routine. For solo practitioners and small firm attorneys, it represents a much more significant commitment.</p>

            <h2>Who Should Attend ABA TECHSHOW?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solo practitioners and small firm attorneys</strong> looking for practical technology advice they can implement immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal technologists</strong> who support small to mid-size firms and want to discover new tools and techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Law school faculty and students</strong> interested in legal technology education and career development.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal aid and public interest attorneys</strong> seeking affordable technology solutions for resource-constrained organizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal tech startups</strong> wanting to showcase products to a receptive, tech-curious attorney audience.</li>
                <li><strong>ABA members</strong> who want to earn CLE credits and engage with the ABA technology community.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who Should Attend Legalweek?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>E-discovery professionals</strong> who need to stay current on the latest tools, techniques, and case law.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal operations managers</strong> at corporations and large law firms focused on efficiency and technology strategy.</li>
                <li><strong>BigLaw technology leaders</strong> evaluating enterprise-scale platforms for their firms.</li>
                <li><strong>Corporate counsel</strong> overseeing legal department technology budgets and vendor relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Enterprise legal tech vendors</strong> targeting large law firms and corporate legal departments.</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance professionals</strong> tracking regulatory technology and information governance trends.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Can You Attend Both? Logistics and Strategy</h2>
            <p>Attending both ABA TECHSHOW and Legalweek is absolutely feasible and can provide a comprehensive view of the legal technology landscape. The events happen about a month apart, with TECHSHOW typically in late February or early March and Legalweek in late March or early April, in different cities.</p>
            <p>Here is a strategy for getting the most out of both events:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start with TECHSHOW.</strong> Its earlier date and practical focus make it an excellent warm-up for the legal tech conference season. Use TECHSHOW to discover new tools, learn implementation techniques, and connect with the practitioner community.</li>
                <li><strong>Apply TECHSHOW insights at Legalweek.</strong> Armed with knowledge from TECHSHOW, you can ask more informed questions at Legalweek and evaluate enterprise solutions with a practical perspective.</li>
                <li><strong>Use different registration tiers.</strong> If budget is a concern, consider a full pass at the event most aligned with your role and an expo-only or single-day pass at the other. This lets you network at both without doubling your registration investment.</li>
                <li><strong>Prioritize networking differently at each event.</strong> At TECHSHOW, focus on peer-to-peer connections with attorneys who share your practice challenges. At Legalweek, focus on vendor relationships and enterprise contacts that might lead to partnerships or job opportunities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Verdict: Which Conference Is Right for You?</h2>
            <p>The choice between ABA TECHSHOW and Legalweek comes down to the size of your practice and the nature of your technology needs.</p>
            <p>Choose <strong>ABA TECHSHOW</strong> if you are a practicing attorney, solo practitioner, or small firm professional who wants actionable technology guidance you can implement in your own practice. TECHSHOW's intimate size, affordable cost, and practitioner-focused content make it the most valuable conference for attorneys who are personally hands-on with technology. The community is welcoming, the sessions are practical, and you will leave with a list of tools and techniques you can start using immediately.</p>
            <p>Choose <strong>Legalweek</strong> if you work in legal operations, e-discovery, or enterprise legal technology at a large law firm or corporate legal department. Legalweek's scale, enterprise focus, and deep specialization in e-discovery and legal ops make it the premier event for professionals dealing with large-scale technology challenges. The networking opportunities with BigLaw leaders and corporate counsel are unmatched in the legal tech space.</p>
            <p>For legal technology vendors, the answer depends on your target market. If you sell to small firms and solo practitioners, TECHSHOW is where your buyers are. If you sell enterprise solutions to AmLaw 200 firms and Fortune 500 legal departments, Legalweek provides the highest concentration of qualified buyers. If you serve both segments, attending both events with tailored messaging for each audience is the strongest approach.</p>
