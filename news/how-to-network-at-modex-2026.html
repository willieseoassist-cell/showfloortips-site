    <h2>Overview: The Supply Chain Industry's Biggest Stage</h2>
    <p>MODEX 2026 takes over the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta from April 13 through 16, bringing together more than 50,000 supply chain, logistics, and manufacturing professionals for four days of exhibitions, education, and deal-making. Produced by MHI, the nation's largest material handling and logistics industry association, MODEX is the premier event for anyone involved in moving, storing, or managing goods across the supply chain.</p>
    <p>The exhibit floor at MODEX spans more than 400,000 square feet and features over 1,000 exhibitors showcasing everything from autonomous mobile robots and warehouse management systems to conveyor technology and packaging solutions. The attendee profile is heavily weighted toward decision-makers: warehouse directors, supply chain VPs, logistics managers, operations executives, and procurement leads from companies ranging from Fortune 500 retailers to mid-market manufacturers and third-party logistics providers. If you sell to, partner with, or serve the supply chain industry, MODEX is where your next major relationship begins. Here is how to make it count.</p>

    <h2>Key Networking Events at MODEX 2026</h2>
    <p><strong>MODEX Keynote Sessions.</strong> The keynote presentations at MODEX draw thousands of attendees and feature industry leaders discussing the most pressing supply chain challenges: labor shortages, automation adoption, sustainability mandates, and supply chain resilience. The keynotes serve as shared experiences that give every attendee a common conversation topic for the rest of the day. The hallway immediately outside the keynote hall, in the 10 to 15 minutes after each session, is one of the most productive networking zones at the entire event.</p>
    <p><strong>MHI Industry Night.</strong> MHI hosts an Industry Night reception that is one of the signature social events of MODEX. This evening gathering brings together exhibitors, attendees, and industry association members in a relaxed setting with food, drinks, and entertainment. The atmosphere is collegial and the conversations are candid, making it an ideal environment for building relationships that go beyond the transactional exchanges of the exhibit floor.</p>
    <p><strong>MODEX Education Seminars.</strong> MODEX offers more than 150 education sessions across tracks including robotics and automation, workforce development, supply chain technology, and sustainability. These sessions, typically drawing 50 to 200 attendees each, are outstanding networking environments because the people in each room have self-selected by interest. The sessions on warehouse automation, autonomous mobile robots, and AI-driven inventory management tend to attract the most senior and engaged audiences.</p>
    <p><strong>Solutions Theater Presentations.</strong> Located on the exhibit floor, the Solutions Theaters feature short presentations by exhibitors and industry experts throughout each day. These 20-to-30-minute sessions draw small, focused crowds of attendees interested in specific technologies or approaches. The informal setting makes it easy to connect with fellow audience members before and after each presentation.</p>
    <p><strong>Exhibitor-Hosted Events.</strong> Major exhibitors like Dematic, Honeywell Intelligrated, KION Group, AutoStore, and Locus Robotics host customer appreciation events, dinners, and demonstrations during MODEX week. These private events are among the most valuable networking opportunities at the show because the guest lists are curated and the attendees are typically senior decision-makers. If you are an existing customer, contact your sales rep to secure an invitation. If you are a prospective partner, use LinkedIn to identify and reach out to relevant contacts at your target companies before the show.</p>
    <p><strong>Live Demonstrations on the Show Floor.</strong> MODEX is known for its working product demonstrations, with exhibitors running live warehouse automation systems, robotic picking solutions, and conveyor systems on the exhibit floor. These demonstrations attract clusters of attendees and create natural conversation opportunities. Standing next to someone watching a robotic arm pick and place products at high speed gives you an immediate shared experience to discuss.</p>

    <h2>Best Networking Spots Inside and Outside the Venue</h2>
    <p><strong>The Atrium and Lobby Areas of the Georgia World Congress Center.</strong> The GWCC's atrium is a massive, open space that serves as the primary gathering area for MODEX attendees. People congregate here before the exhibit hall opens, during breaks, and at the end of each day. The coffee stations and seating areas within the atrium are particularly good spots for catching people in a receptive mood.</p>
    <p><strong>The Skybridge to CNN Center and Omni Hotel.</strong> The enclosed skywalk connecting the GWCC to the Omni Hotel at CNN Center is a heavily trafficked corridor that MODEX attendees use throughout the day. The walk takes just long enough for a brief introduction and exchange of contact information, and the captive environment means people are more receptive to conversation than they would be on the hectic show floor.</p>
    <p><strong>The Food Courts and Concession Areas.</strong> The concession areas within the GWCC fill at lunchtime and during afternoon breaks. Sharing a table with a stranger is perfectly normal at MODEX, and the casual dining setting lowers barriers to conversation. The supply chain industry is fundamentally practical and unpretentious, and some of the best connections happen over a quick lunch.</p>
    <p><strong>Downtown Atlanta Restaurants.</strong> After the exhibit hall closes, the supply chain crowd migrates to the restaurants and bars in downtown Atlanta and the surrounding neighborhoods. Establishments along Marietta Street and in the Castleberry Hill area, as well as the restaurants in the Omni Hotel, fill with MODEX attendees during the show. The bars and restaurants at the Westin Peachtree Plaza and the Marriott Marquis are also popular gathering spots. Atlanta's restaurant scene is diverse and welcoming, and the Southern hospitality ethos makes it easy to strike up conversations.</p>
    <p><strong>Hotel Lobbies at the Omni and Westin.</strong> The Omni Hotel at CNN Center and the Westin Peachtree Plaza, both within walking distance of the GWCC, serve as unofficial meeting hubs for MODEX attendees. Their lobbies and bars fill with supply chain professionals from early morning through late evening, and many executives use these spaces for scheduled meetings throughout the week.</p>

    <h2>Conversation Starters for the Supply Chain Crowd</h2>
    <p>Supply chain professionals are pragmatic, data-driven, and focused on tangible results. They have little patience for buzzwords or abstract pitches and respond best to conversations grounded in real operational challenges.</p>
    <p><strong>At a booth:</strong> "What is the typical implementation timeline for this, and what does the change management piece look like? We have had challenges getting warehouse teams to adopt new technology." This question reveals that you understand the real-world complexities of supply chain technology adoption, which instantly builds credibility with both vendors and fellow attendees.</p>
    <p><strong>At an education session:</strong> "Are you seeing the same labor challenges in your operations, or have you found ways to work around the shortage? I am curious how different industries are approaching it." Labor availability is the defining challenge in logistics and warehousing right now, and everyone at MODEX has a perspective on it. This question opens a rich conversation channel.</p>
    <p><strong>At a live demonstration:</strong> "How does this compare to what you are running in your facility? We are evaluating similar systems, and I would love to hear from someone who has been through the selection process." Asking for peer experience at a demo signals that you are a serious buyer, and other attendees who have already deployed similar systems are often happy to share their insights.</p>
    <p><strong>At an evening event:</strong> "What was the most surprising thing you saw on the floor today? I spent most of my time in the robotics section and I know I missed a lot." This is casual, genuine, and invites the other person to share their discoveries, which naturally deepens the conversation.</p>
    <p>One important principle: the supply chain community is tight-knit and reputation-driven. Logistics professionals talk to each other, and your behavior at MODEX follows you. Be genuine, be helpful, and never oversell. The operators who attend MODEX can spot a hollow pitch from across the exhibit hall.</p>

    <h2>Your Post-MODEX Follow-Up Strategy</h2>
    <p>MODEX alternates every other year with ProMat, which means the connections you make here need to carry you through a two-year cycle. That makes disciplined follow-up even more critical than at annual events.</p>
    <p><strong>During the show:</strong> Capture contact information and context immediately after every meaningful conversation. Use a lead capture tool like Scannly, photograph business cards, or take quick notes in your phone. Record what they are evaluating, what facility or operation they manage, and what specific challenge they described. By Thursday afternoon, dozens of conversations will start blending together, and your notes are the only reliable record.</p>
    <p><strong>Within 48 hours of the show ending:</strong> Send personalized follow-up messages to your top contacts. Reference the specific technology you discussed, the facility challenge they mentioned, or the education session you both attended. For example: "Great connecting at the AutoStore demo on Tuesday. The throughput numbers you shared from your Dallas DC were impressive, and I would love to compare notes on how you handled the WMS integration."</p>
    <p><strong>Within two weeks:</strong> For your highest-priority contacts, propose a concrete next step. A facility tour, a technical assessment call, a demo of your solution configured for their use case, or an introduction to a peer who has solved a similar challenge. Supply chain professionals respond to specificity and relevance. Generic follow-ups get lost.</p>
    <p><strong>Ongoing through the cycle:</strong> Supply chain technology purchases often involve 6-to-18-month evaluation and procurement cycles. Add your MODEX contacts to your CRM with detailed notes, set regular check-in reminders, and share relevant content: case studies, ROI analyses, industry benchmarks, and supply chain research reports. The goal is to remain a useful resource between shows so that when budget approvals come through or new facility projects launch, you are already part of the conversation.</p>
    <p>MODEX 2026 is the supply chain industry's biennial gathering point. The professionals who extract the most value are those who arrive with targeted objectives, engage in substantive conversations grounded in real operational challenges, and follow up with the consistency and reliability that the logistics industry demands. Plan your booth visits, prioritize your education sessions, and remember that in supply chain, results and reliability are what earn long-term partnerships.</p>
