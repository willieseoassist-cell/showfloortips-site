    <h2>The Packaging World's Two Biggest Events</h2>
    <p>The global packaging industry has two flagship trade shows that tower above all others: PACK EXPO International, produced by PMMI (the Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies), and interpack, organized by Messe Dusseldorf. Together, these events attract more than 120,000 packaging professionals and represent the most comprehensive showcase of packaging machinery, materials, and solutions available anywhere in the world.</p>
    <p>But they are not interchangeable. PACK EXPO and interpack serve different geographic markets, attract different buyer profiles, and operate on different cycles. For packaging machinery suppliers, contract packagers, brand owners, and materials companies trying to decide where to invest their trade show budget, understanding the distinctions between these two events is critical. This comparison provides the data and context you need to make that decision.</p>

    <h2>Audience and Geographic Reach</h2>
    <p>PACK EXPO International is overwhelmingly a North American event. While it draws international visitors from more than 130 countries, the core attendee base consists of packaging engineers, operations managers, procurement specialists, and plant directors from US and Canadian consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies, food and beverage manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and contract packaging organizations. The show's location at McCormick Place in Chicago makes it highly accessible for domestic travelers and positions it as the primary buying event for the North American packaging market.</p>
    <p>interpack is the global packaging industry's most international gathering. With more than 176,000 attendees from approximately 170 countries, interpack draws a genuinely worldwide audience that no other packaging event can match. European attendees form the largest contingent, but significant delegations arrive from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. For companies seeking to establish or expand international distribution, interpack provides access to buyers and distributors from markets that are simply not well-represented at PACK EXPO.</p>
    <p>This geographic distinction has practical implications. If your primary market is North America and you are looking to connect with domestic CPG companies and contract packagers, PACK EXPO delivers a more concentrated and relevant audience. If you are pursuing international growth or need to meet buyers from Europe, Asia, or emerging markets, interpack is irreplaceable.</p>

    <h2>Show Floor and Exhibition Experience</h2>
    <p>PACK EXPO International spans approximately 1.2 million square feet across multiple halls at McCormick Place, making it one of the largest trade shows in North America by floor space. The show is organized by packaging function, with dedicated zones for food processing, pharmaceutical packaging, containers and materials, automation, and sustainability. PMMI's show organization is efficient, with well-designed aisle layouts, clear signage, and robust on-floor programming including the Innovation Stage and the Packaging and Processing Women's Leadership Network events. The four-day format allows attendees to cover the show thoroughly without feeling rushed.</p>
    <p>interpack is an entirely different scale of experience. Spanning seven full days across 18 halls at Messe Dusseldorf, interpack occupies approximately 1.8 million square feet of exhibition space. The show's sheer size means that even the most efficient attendee cannot see everything. This scale is both interpack's greatest strength and its biggest challenge. The breadth of technology on display is unmatched, but the physical demands of navigating the venue for a full week are considerable. Experienced interpack attendees plan their hall visits carefully, dedicating specific days to specific technology categories, and accept that they will miss some areas entirely.</p>

    <h2>Networking and Business Development</h2>
    <p>PACK EXPO networking is efficient, concentrated, and deal-oriented. The North American packaging industry is relationship-driven, and PACK EXPO serves as the annual reunion where those relationships are maintained and new ones are formed. Many exhibitors report that their most productive meetings happen not at their booths but at the show's numerous receptions, dinners, and after-hours events hosted by PMMI member companies. The Chicago location provides abundant dining and entertainment options for evening networking, with many exhibitors hosting events at venues throughout the city.</p>
    <p>interpack networking is more international and exploratory. The seven-day format allows for deeper relationship building, as attendees have more time for extended booth visits and multi-meeting conversations that develop over the course of the week. The international audience creates opportunities for cross-cultural business development that PACK EXPO cannot replicate. However, language barriers can be a factor, and the dispersed hotel landscape in Dusseldorf makes spontaneous evening networking less concentrated than in Chicago. Many exhibitors address this by hosting invitation-only events at venues in Dusseldorf's Altstadt (old town) district.</p>

    <h2>Cost Analysis</h2>
    <p>From a pure registration standpoint, PACK EXPO is remarkably affordable. Advance registration costs just $30, making it one of the most accessible major trade shows in any industry. Chicago hotel rates during PACK EXPO week are moderate by major-city standards, and domestic airfare keeps travel costs manageable for US-based attendees. The four-day format also limits the total trip investment in hotel nights and per diem expenses.</p>
    <p>interpack's total cost of attendance is significantly higher. Registration fees start at EUR 70 for a single day, and the seven-day format means attendees typically need five to seven nights of accommodation in Dusseldorf, where hotel rates during interpack inflate considerably. International airfare, ground transportation, and the general cost of doing business in Germany add up quickly. For a US-based team of three attending interpack for five days, total trip costs can easily exceed $25,000 to $30,000 before exhibiting costs are factored in.</p>
    <p>However, cost per contact tells a different story. interpack's massive international audience means that companies pursuing global distribution can meet buyers from dozens of countries in a single week, a feat that would require multiple regional shows and significantly more total travel to replicate.</p>

    <h2>Event Frequency and Timing</h2>
    <p>An important strategic consideration is that these shows operate on different cycles. PACK EXPO International runs every two years in Chicago (alternating with PACK EXPO Las Vegas in odd years). interpack also runs on a three-year cycle, with 2025 being the most recent edition and the next scheduled for 2028. This means the shows rarely conflict with each other directly, and many serious packaging industry players attend both on their respective cycles.</p>
    <p>The timing within the calendar year also matters. interpack in May and PACK EXPO in November bookend the calendar nicely, allowing companies to launch products or announce innovations at interpack and follow up with the North American market at PACK EXPO later in the year, or vice versa.</p>

    <h2>The Verdict</h2>
    <p>Choose PACK EXPO International 2026 if your primary market is North America, your target customers are US-based CPG companies or contract packagers, and you want an efficient, cost-effective show that delivers high-quality domestic leads. PACK EXPO is also the right choice for companies that need to demonstrate machinery in a domestic setting and want to leverage the show's proximity to their existing customer base.</p>
    <p>Choose interpack if you are pursuing international growth, need access to buyers from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, or emerging markets, or want to showcase your technology to the broadest possible global audience. interpack is the right investment for companies that have outgrown their domestic market and need a platform that matches their international ambitions.</p>
    <p>For companies serious about the global packaging market, the answer is often both. These shows complement rather than compete with each other, and the industry's top suppliers maintain active presences at both events on their respective cycles.
