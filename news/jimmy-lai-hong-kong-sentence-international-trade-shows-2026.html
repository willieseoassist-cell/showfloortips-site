<h1>Jimmy Lai's 20-Year Sentence Is a Warning Signal for Every Company Exhibiting in Asia</h1>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536599018102-9f803c140fc1?w=1920&q=80" alt="Hong Kong skyline with dramatic clouds over Victoria Harbour" loading="lazy">

<p>Jimmy Lai, the 78-year-old founder of Hong Kong's Apple Daily newspaper and one of the most prominent pro-democracy voices in the city's history, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday under Beijing's national security law. His colleagues received sentences ranging from six to ten years. The verdict represents the longest punishment delivered under the security law since its imposition in 2020, and it effectively guarantees that Lai will spend the rest of his life in prison.</p>

<p>The international condemnation was swift. Press freedom organizations called it a death blow to Hong Kong's independent media. Western governments issued statements of concern. And quietly, in corporate boardrooms and event planning offices around the world, a different conversation is accelerating: what does this mean for doing business — and specifically, for exhibiting at trade shows — in Hong Kong and mainland China?</p>

<p>The answer is complicated, but the direction is clear. The ground has shifted, and trade show strategies built on the assumption that Hong Kong operates as a neutral, Western-friendly business hub need to be reexamined.</p>

<h2>Hong Kong's Trade Show Industry Was Already Under Pressure</h2>

<p>Hong Kong has been one of the world's premier trade show destinations for decades. The Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) and AsiaWorld-Expo have hosted some of the most important B2B events in electronics, jewelry, toys, fashion, and financial services. The city's appeal was straightforward: a stable legal system inherited from British rule, world-class infrastructure, a strategic location bridging Western and Chinese markets, and a regulatory environment that made it easy for international companies to do business.</p>

<p>That proposition has been eroding since 2020. The national security law, the dismantling of the pro-democracy movement, increased mainland Chinese influence over the judiciary, and heightened surveillance have fundamentally changed the operating environment. International exhibitor participation at major Hong Kong trade fairs has been declining. Some companies have shifted their Asian trade show presence to Singapore, Bangkok, Seoul, or Tokyo.</p>

<p>The Lai sentencing accelerates this trend. It is not just about one man going to prison. It is about what the sentence signals regarding the trajectory of Hong Kong's legal and business environment.</p>

<blockquote>When a government sentences a businessman to 20 years for what amounts to exercising free speech, every other businessperson in the jurisdiction recalculates their risk exposure. Trade show executives are no exception.</blockquote>

<h2>The Practical Impact on Exhibition Planning</h2>

<p>For trade show organizers and exhibitors making decisions about their 2026 and 2027 Asian event calendars, the Lai sentencing raises several concrete concerns.</p>

<h3>Data and Intellectual Property Exposure</h3>

<p>Exhibitors at trade shows routinely display proprietary technology, conduct product demonstrations, share competitive intelligence with potential partners, and collect sensitive customer data through badge scanning and lead capture. In an environment where the legal framework has shifted toward state surveillance and national security enforcement, companies — particularly those in technology, defense, telecommunications, and media — need to reassess what they are comfortable displaying and collecting at Hong Kong events.</p>

<p>This is not theoretical. Multiple multinational companies have already implemented policies restricting the type of proprietary information that employees can carry on devices when traveling to Hong Kong or mainland China. Some have issued guidelines that company laptops used at Hong Kong trade shows should contain only the materials needed for the event and no other sensitive data.</p>

<h3>Employee Safety and Travel Risk</h3>

<p>The national security law's broad and ambiguous language means that activities considered routine in Western democracies — public criticism of government policy, social media posts, support for certain causes — could theoretically create legal exposure in Hong Kong. For companies sending employees to exhibit at Hong Kong trade shows, this creates a duty-of-care question that did not exist a decade ago.</p>

<p>Corporate travel risk assessments for Hong Kong have been quietly upgraded at many multinational firms. Some companies now include Hong Kong in the same risk briefing category as mainland China, requiring employees to acknowledge specific guidelines before travel is approved.</p>

<h3>The Reputational Calculation</h3>

<p>There is also a reputational dimension. As Western governments escalate their criticism of Hong Kong's legal trajectory, some companies face pressure from employees, shareholders, and customers to reconsider their visible presence in the city. Exhibiting at a high-profile Hong Kong trade show is a public statement of engagement with the market. For companies in sensitive sectors, that visibility is now a factor in the decision-making process.</p>

<h2>Where the Asian Trade Show Map Is Shifting</h2>

<p>The beneficiaries of Hong Kong's declining appeal as a trade show hub are becoming clear.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Singapore</strong> has aggressively positioned itself as the primary alternative, with massive investment in the Singapore EXPO and Sands Expo and Convention Centre. Its political stability, strong IP protections, and neutral geopolitical positioning make it attractive to Western exhibitors who want Asian market access without the complications of Hong Kong or mainland China.</li>
<li><strong>Bangkok</strong> is emerging as a cost-effective option for mid-sized exhibitions, with modern convention infrastructure and a growing reputation as a regional business hub.</li>
<li><strong>Seoul and Tokyo</strong> continue to attract technology-focused exhibitions, benefiting from strong domestic markets and stable geopolitical alignment with Western trading partners.</li>
<li><strong>Mainland China</strong> shows — particularly in Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Guangzhou — remain essential for companies that need direct access to Chinese manufacturers and buyers. But the decision to exhibit in mainland China is increasingly treated as a separate strategic question from the broader Asian trade show strategy, with its own risk assessment and compliance framework.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Exhibitors Should Do Now</h2>

<p>If you exhibit at trade shows in Asia, the Lai sentencing should prompt three immediate actions.</p>

<p>First, review your 2026-2027 Asian event calendar with your legal and compliance teams. Ask specifically whether any events on your calendar trigger concerns about data exposure, employee safety, or reputational risk given the current geopolitical environment. This is a conversation that should involve your general counsel, not just your marketing department.</p>

<p>Second, evaluate alternative venues for any events currently held exclusively in Hong Kong. If your primary Asian exhibition is a Hong Kong show, identify comparable events in Singapore, Tokyo, or Seoul and run a comparative analysis. You may conclude that Hong Kong still makes sense for your specific market. But you should be making that decision actively, not by default.</p>

<p>Third, update your employee travel guidelines for Hong Kong and mainland China. Ensure that booth staff traveling to these destinations understand the current legal environment, know what not to post on social media while in the jurisdiction, and are equipped with appropriately configured devices.</p>

<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

<p>Jimmy Lai's sentence is about much more than one man's imprisonment. It is the latest and most definitive signal that Hong Kong's era as a uniquely open, Western-oriented business hub is over. For the trade show industry — which has relied on Hong Kong as a bridge between Western exhibitors and Asian markets for decades — this means the map is being redrawn in real time.</p>

<p>The companies that adapt their Asian exhibition strategies now will be positioned to capture market opportunities through the venues and events that are rising to replace Hong Kong's former role. Those that continue operating on autopilot risk finding themselves exhibiting in a city where the audience has already moved somewhere else.</p>
