    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Healthcare technology professionals evaluating their 2026 event calendar will inevitably encounter two names that tower above the rest: HIMSS (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society) Global Health Conference and MEDICA, the world's largest medical trade fair. Both are essential events for the healthcare industry, but they serve fundamentally different audiences, cover different technology domains, and operate in different parts of the world. Choosing between them, or understanding how they complement each other, is a critical strategic decision for any healthcare company allocating its event budget.</p>
    <p>HIMSS 2026 takes place March 9-13 at the Venetian Convention and Expo Center in Las Vegas, focusing on health information technology, digital health, cybersecurity, and clinical informatics. MEDICA 2026 runs November 16-19 at Messe Dusseldorf in Germany, covering the full breadth of medical technology from diagnostic imaging and laboratory equipment to wearable devices and medical IT. This guide provides an in-depth comparison to help you decide which event, or both, deserves your time and investment.</p>

    <h2>Audience: Who Attends Each Event?</h2>
    <p><strong>HIMSS</strong> attracts the most concentrated gathering of health IT decision-makers in the world. The attendee base is dominated by CIOs, CTOs, CMIOs, VPs of IT, and directors of clinical informatics from hospital systems, health plans, and government health agencies across the United States. You will also find a significant presence of EHR vendors, cybersecurity firms, population health analytics companies, revenue cycle management providers, and the consulting firms that advise healthcare organizations on technology strategy. International attendance has grown steadily, but HIMSS remains fundamentally a U.S.-centric event. If your target buyer is an American hospital system CIO deciding between competing health IT platforms, there is no higher-concentration event on the calendar.</p>
    <p><strong>MEDICA</strong> draws over 81,000 visitors from more than 170 countries, making it the most internationally diverse healthcare event in the world. The attendee base spans the complete healthcare ecosystem: hospital administrators, procurement directors, biomedical engineers, laboratory professionals, clinicians, regulatory affairs specialists, and government health ministry officials from every continent. The exhibitor base is equally broad, covering medical devices, imaging equipment, diagnostics, disposable medical supplies, physiotherapy technology, and, increasingly, medical IT and digital health. If your product is a physical medical device, a diagnostic platform, or laboratory equipment, and you are targeting international markets, MEDICA offers unparalleled access to buyers from emerging and established markets alike.</p>

    <h2>Location and Logistics</h2>
    <p><strong>HIMSS in Las Vegas</strong> benefits from the city's exceptional convention infrastructure. The Venetian Convention and Expo Center is a modern, walkable venue with excellent restaurants and hotels integrated into the complex. Harry Reid International Airport offers direct flights from virtually every U.S. city and many international hubs. Hotels range from budget to luxury, though rates spike during HIMSS week. Las Vegas is logistically convenient for North American attendees but requires a long international flight for European or Asian professionals considering the trip.</p>
    <p><strong>MEDICA in Dusseldorf</strong> takes place at Messe Dusseldorf, one of the world's largest and most professionally operated exhibition campuses. The venue's 17 halls are connected by a covered boulevard and served by a dedicated tram station (Messe Ost/Stockumer Kirchstrasse) and highway access. Dusseldorf Airport is a major European hub with direct flights from cities across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Hotels in the city range from budget accommodations near the Hauptbahnhof to luxury properties on Konigsallee, though rooms during MEDICA week should be booked months in advance. For international attendees, particularly those from Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, Dusseldorf is more accessible than Las Vegas.</p>

    <h2>Cost Comparison</h2>
    <p><strong>HIMSS</strong> carries a significant registration cost. A full conference pass runs $1,295 to $2,395 depending on HIMSS membership status and registration timing. The exhibit hall-only pass is free with promotional codes, but it excludes education sessions and many networking events. Exhibitor booth costs begin around $4,500 for a small space. Add Las Vegas hotel rates during HIMSS week ($200 to $500 per night), domestic flights, and meals, and a typical attendee should budget $3,000 to $5,000 for the week. For exhibitors with a small booth and a two-person team, all-in costs typically range from $15,000 to $30,000.</p>
    <p><strong>MEDICA</strong> is dramatically more affordable for visitors. Day passes cost approximately $35, and multi-day passes run around $58. Many exhibitors distribute free visitor codes. Exhibitor booth costs are competitive, with shell scheme booths starting around $5,000 depending on hall and location. Dusseldorf hotel rates during MEDICA week are comparable to mid-tier Las Vegas pricing ($150 to $350 per night), though the proximity to other German cities means budget-conscious attendees can stay in Cologne, a twenty-minute train ride away, for significantly less. International airfare from North America adds to the total, but for attendees already based in Europe, MEDICA is far less expensive to attend than HIMSS.</p>

    <h2>Exhibition Experience</h2>
    <p>The exhibition experiences are profoundly different. HIMSS concentrates health IT and digital health exhibitors in a single modern hall. The result is a focused, efficient experience where you can walk the entire floor in a day and quickly identify the vendors most relevant to your needs. The booths trend toward large, corporate installations from major EHR vendors, cybersecurity companies, and cloud platforms, with a growing startup section for emerging digital health companies.</p>
    <p>MEDICA's exhibition is vastly larger and more diverse. With 5,800 exhibitors across 17 halls, it takes the full four days to explore the show floor comprehensively. Each hall is organized by product category: imaging, laboratory, medical IT, disposables, physiotherapy, and more. The range of exhibitors spans from Fortune 500 medical device companies to small manufacturers from emerging economies offering their products for the first time at an international trade fair. This scale can be overwhelming without preparation, but for professionals who plan their hall visits and pre-schedule meetings, it offers a breadth of product discovery that no other single event can match.</p>

    <h2>Verdict: Which Event Is Right for You?</h2>
    <p><strong>Choose HIMSS 2026 if:</strong> Your company develops or sells health IT solutions, including EHR platforms, telehealth systems, healthcare cybersecurity tools, interoperability middleware, clinical decision support software, or AI-driven analytics. Your primary market is the United States, and your target buyers are CIOs, CTOs, and IT leadership at hospital systems and health plans. HIMSS is the undisputed leader in health information technology, and its education program, interoperability showcases, and cybersecurity forums are the most comprehensive in the industry. The conference sessions alone can be worth the registration fee for staying current on regulations like TEFCA, standards like FHIR, and emerging policy frameworks.</p>
    <p><strong>Choose MEDICA 2026 if:</strong> Your company manufactures or distributes medical devices, diagnostic equipment, laboratory technology, imaging systems, or medical supplies. You are targeting international markets, particularly in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Your buyers are hospital procurement directors, biomedical engineers, or government health officials. MEDICA's global reach, enormous scale, and the co-located COMPAMED supplier fair make it the essential event for the medtech supply chain. The barrier to entry for visitors is also far lower, with affordable registration that makes it accessible for scouting trips and preliminary market research.</p>
    <p><strong>Attend both if:</strong> You are a healthcare company with products that span both health IT and medical devices. Companies like Philips, Siemens Healthineers, GE HealthCare, and Baxter exhibit at both events because their product portfolios span the digital and physical dimensions of healthcare technology. HIMSS gives you depth in the U.S. health IT market; MEDICA gives you global breadth across the entire medtech spectrum. The eight-month gap between the events (March and November) makes it logistically manageable to build both into your annual trade show calendar.</p>
    <p>The fundamental question is whether your product is primarily digital or primarily physical, and whether your target market is primarily American or primarily international. Answer those two questions honestly, and the right choice becomes clear. Both events are world-class, and the professionals who attend the one best aligned with their strategy leave with networks and opportunities that justify the investment many times over.</p>
