<p>Your first trade show can be a career-defining success or an expensive lesson. The difference usually comes down to preparation. Here are the 15 most common first-time exhibitor mistakes — and exactly how to avoid each one.</p>

<h2>1. Not Setting Measurable Goals</h2>
<p>Vague goals like "get our name out there" make it impossible to measure ROI. Set specific targets: 50 qualified leads, 10 demo appointments, 3 partnership meetings. Without numbers, you can't calculate whether the show was worth the investment.</p>

<h2>2. Ordering Show Services After the Deadline</h2>
<p>Every show service — electrical, drayage, internet, furniture — has an "advance" rate and an "at-show" rate. The at-show rate is typically 30-40% higher. Missing the advance deadline on a 20x20 booth can cost an extra $2,000-$5,000.</p>

<h2>3. Shipping Freight Too Late</h2>
<p>The advance warehouse has a receiving window. Miss it and your materials go to the show site at premium "direct-to-show" drayage rates. Worse, if your freight arrives after setup begins, you might be building your booth while the show is already open.</p>

<h2>4. Skipping Pre-Show Marketing</h2>
<p>80% of trade show attendees plan their booth visits before arriving. If you're not in their plan, you're relying entirely on walk-by traffic. Send emails, post on social media, and schedule appointments at least 3 weeks before the show.</p>

<h2>5. Overstaffing or Understaffing the Booth</h2>
<p>Too many people in a 10x10 booth creates a wall that repels visitors. Too few means missed connections. Rule of thumb: one staffer per 50 square feet of booth space, with shift rotations to keep energy high.</p>

<h2>6. Not Training Booth Staff</h2>
<p>Your booth team needs to know: the elevator pitch (under 30 seconds), qualification questions, demo flow, and lead capture process. A 1-hour training session the day before the show pays for itself many times over.</p>

<h2>7. Relying on the Show's Lead Retrieval System</h2>
<p>Show-provided badge scanners capture basic contact info but rarely integrate with your CRM. Apps like <a href="/scannly.html">Scannly</a> let you add notes, qualify leads, and sync directly to your pipeline.</p>

<h2>8. Sitting in Your Booth</h2>
<p>Sitting signals "I don't want to be bothered." Stand near the aisle edge, make eye contact, and engage passersby. Studies show standing booth staff generate 3x more conversations than seated staff.</p>

<h2>9. No Follow-Up Plan</h2>
<p>50% of trade show leads are never followed up. Have email templates ready, assign leads to sales reps before you leave the show, and commit to contacting every lead within 48 hours.</p>

<h2>10. Choosing the Wrong Booth Location</h2>
<p>Avoid dead-end aisles, back corners, and spots next to food courts (people rush past). Request locations near entrances, restrooms, or session rooms where foot traffic is highest. Study the floor plan before signing.</p>

<h2>11. Bringing Too Much Inventory</h2>
<p>Every pound you ship costs money in freight and drayage. Bring enough product for demos and display, not your entire warehouse. Ship excess inventory back from the show site to avoid expensive return drayage.</p>

<h2>12. Ignoring Your Neighbors</h2>
<p>The exhibitors next to you are potential partners, referral sources, or future customers. Introduce yourself during setup, share leads that aren't relevant to you, and build relationships that outlast the show.</p>

<h2>13. Not Getting Certificate of Insurance Early</h2>
<p>Most venues require a COI listing the show organizer and convention center as additional insured. This can take 1-2 weeks to process. Last-minute requests mean premium rush fees from your insurance broker.</p>

<h2>14. Forgetting About Drayage</h2>
<p>Drayage (material handling) is the #1 surprise cost for first-time exhibitors. At $150-$250 per 100 pounds, a 1,000-pound booth shipment costs $1,500-$2,500 just to move from the dock to your space — and the same again to move it back.</p>

<h2>15. Not Calculating ROI After the Show</h2>
<p>Without measuring results, you can't improve. Track: total cost, leads captured, leads converted, revenue generated. Use the <a href="/roi-calculator.html">ShowFloorTips ROI Calculator</a> to see your actual return and decide whether to rebook.</p>
