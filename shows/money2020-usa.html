            <p>Success at Money20/20 USA starts weeks before the show opens. Here's your preparation checklist:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Set clear goals:</strong> Define what success looks like—leads generated, meetings booked, or brand awareness metrics.</li>
                <li><strong>Book early:</strong> Premium booth locations go fast. Register early for the best positioning.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote your presence:</strong> Email your customers, post on social media, and update your website with show details.</li>
                <li><strong>Train your team:</strong> Everyone at your booth should know your key messages and lead qualification criteria.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare collateral:</strong> Order business cards, brochures, and promotional items well in advance.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Booth Design Tips for Finance</h2>
            
            <p>Your booth is your brand's home for the duration of Money20/20 USA. Make it count:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep it open:</strong> Avoid barriers that prevent attendees from entering your space.</li>
                <li><strong>Use vertical space:</strong> Tall banners and hanging signs increase visibility from across the floor.</li>
                <li><strong>Create an experience:</strong> Interactive elements increase dwell time and engagement.</li>
                <li>Design an eye-catching booth that reflects your brand</li><li>Train your team on product knowledge and elevator pitches</li><li>Follow up with leads within 48 hours of the show</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Lead Capture Strategy</h2>
            
            <p>Collecting leads efficiently is crucial at Money20/20 USA. Here's how to do it right:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Use digital capture:</strong> QR codes like <a href="https://scannly.app">Scannly</a> eliminate manual data entry and ensure no lead gets lost.</li>
                <li><strong>Qualify immediately:</strong> Use a simple rating system (hot/warm/cold) as you meet each prospect.</li>
                <li><strong>Take notes:</strong> Record specific needs or follow-up actions while the conversation is fresh.</li>
                <li><strong>Offer value:</strong> Give attendees a reason to share their info—exclusive content, demos, or giveaways.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Post-Show Follow-Up</h2>
            
            <p>The real work begins after Money20/20 USA ends. Don't let your leads go cold:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Follow up within 48 hours:</strong> Strike while the iron is hot. Attendees meet hundreds of exhibitors—remind them who you are.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalize your outreach:</strong> Reference specific conversations from the show floor.</li>
                <li><strong>Nurture the relationship:</strong> Not everyone is ready to buy. Add leads to your nurture campaigns.</li>
                <li><strong>Measure results:</strong> Track conversion rates to calculate your true ROI from Money20/20 USA.</li>
            </ul>
